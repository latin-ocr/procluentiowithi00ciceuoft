of acute and learned men for centuries, that it is not too,
much to say that, with the exception of a very few sentences
which are hopelessly corrupt, and of these in the pleading
for Cluentius there are not more than three, or at most four,
the Orations of Cicero are, for all practical purposeS, as
correct as the reports given in our best newspapers of the
speeches of our statesmen and lawyers, while the text of the
Greek Tragedians is more certain than that of Shakespeare.

We propose now to divide into classes a large mass of the
various readings given in detail by the editors of Cicero, and
to point out that they may be regarded as of no consequence
in so far as the meaning of the author is concerned, and it
will then be found that when these are struck off, and when
those which, although they cannot be regularly classified,
are at once rejected by any competent scholar, have been
eliminated, the number of those which require consideration
is comparatively trifling.

CLASS I.—Various readings involving mere questions
qf Orthography.

These are very numerous. We might safely conclude, a
priori, even if we had no direct evidence, that, during the
six hundred years which embrace the classical period of
Roman literature, the orthography of many words must have
undergone a change, and that different MSS. would present
the same words under different shapes, according as they
were derived from older or more recent archetypes. Thus,
in the Palimpsests of Cicero, deciphered by Mai and Peyron,
we find generally, although not uniformly‚ the ancient forms
‘ aliqui,’ ‘ nequi‚’ &c., for ⁴ aliquis,’ ‘ nequis,’ διας ‘ aliut‚’ ‘ aput,’
‘illut‚' &c., for ‘aliud,’ ‘apud‚’ ‘illud,' &c.; ‘quom,' ‘voltus,'
‘volgus,’ ‘pervolgare‚' ‘exolare‚’ &c.‚ for ‘quum‚’ ‘vultus‚’
‘ vulgus: ‘ pervulgare,' ‘ exulare,'&c.; ‘ tribunos’ for ‘tribunus,
and the like3 ‘adulescentia‚’ ‘epistula ¹,’ for ‘adolescentia,’

¹ According to Mai, the form ‘epistula' is that which appears in·
variably in all the oldest MSS.
