INTROD UCTION. 2 1

depositions the present proceedings against Cluentius were
founded. Cicero’s reply to the charge is brief, and apparently
conclusive. He argues—

1. That, after the condemnation of Oppianicus, Cluentius
could have had no motive to wish for his death3 he certainly
had nothing to fear from him, and if he hated him, the worst

had persisted in declaring that they knew nothing with regard
to the death of Oppianicus.

7. That there was every reason to believe that the deposi-
