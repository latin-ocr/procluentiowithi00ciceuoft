Classen quotes other examples from Pro Quinct. 26, 5 80, Pro Rosc
Amet. 3, ξ 8; 37, § 104, Pro Ligar. 16, §34-

25. Filio IIS CCCC millia.. So C. Here, as in almost all cases
ubere numbers are concerned, the greatest confusion prevails in the
MSS. We have followed Orelli in adopting the reading of the Turin
Palimpsest, which, being our oldest authority, is, in such a matter, most
likely to be right. Moreover, the sum given in our text, amounting in
round numbers to 23, 300 sterling. is, in the circumstances, reasonable
and probable. A, B, have ⁴ quadraginta millia‚’ or 3330, which is too
-alh most MSS. have ‘IIS CCCC13303,’ i. e. ‘decies,’ or ³68‚3oo‚
which seems too large, but is adopted by Schiitz, while Lambinus intro-
duced ⁴ IIS CCCC13333 millia,’ i.e. 38,300,000‚ which is altogether
monstrous.

27. His diebus paucis. So the MSS. Orelli introduced ‘iis,’
which is a conjecture of Garatoni, and is quite unnecessary.

32. Per quendam Gallicanum. The epithet ⁴ Gallicanus’ must
here denote ⁴ connected with Gaul, or of Gaulish extraction.’ The more
precise and elaborate interpretation given by Lemaire, ‘a native of Gaul
who had settled in Italy‚’ may be true, but is founded upon a conjectural
restoration of a mutilated fragment of the speech In Pisonem, quoted

Δ by Asconius. In another passage ‘ Gallicanus ’ is applied as an epithet
to certain legions ‘ quartered in Gaul: (In Cat. 2. 3.)

P. 88. l. 6. Adolescentia suosque. So A, B, C, Classen, and
Baiter. All other MSS. and edd. have ⁴ adolescentis propinquos suosque,'
&c., but ‘propinquos’ is probably a gloss or correction introduced by
some half-learned transcribet who was puzzled by the construction.

8. Δ.. Aurius, vir fortis et. experiens, et domi nobilis. A, B,
and some other MSS. omit the praenomen A.; others have M. Aurius.
Classen maintains that this Aurius is the same person as the A. Aurius
Melinus of Chap. 5, who married first Cluentia and then Sassia. But
this opinion appears to me quite untenable, sor,—

(1) It is evident from the language here employed by Cicero that heis
introducing this Aurius for the first time, and not referring to a person·
nge previously brought upon the stage.

(2) He never would have spoken so respeetfully—‘ vir fortis et ex-
periens '-os the incestuous husband of Sassia. whom he (5, ξ 11)
characterizes simply as an ⁶ adolescens ' of excellent character ae the time
of his union with Cluentia. The death of the elder Cluentius took
plaoe 88 ιε. (see above 5, ξ 11), his daughter was married to Melinus
soon after (brevi tempore), and the impure passion of Sassia did not
remain long consealed (neque id ipsum diu). The disgraceful union of
the mother-in·law with her son-in-law must have taken place long before
