to the same persons as those indicated in ‘vestro subsidio: and not
to another body of individuals, as the use of the conjunction ‘ac‘ would
imply. The difficulty here discovered seems imaginary. Cicero is
stating a general proposition. As far as the prejudice against my client
is concerned‚ Ι must throw myself upon your high sense of honour
and duty (fides). Upon this alone can Ι rely. ‘For there is no one

who ean withstand the force of prejudice without your aid and the ’

aid of men such as you are '—-·i. e. men of equally high principles with
yourselves. ‘ Tales ’ is not a mere complimentary form in this passage,
but is to be taken in the ordinary and simple acceptation of the word.
Baiter brackets the words ‘ac sine‚’ and is we adopt this view, the
meaning assigned to the passage by Classen will be fairly brought out.

16. Quo me vertam, neseio. This passage is quoted by Romanus
Aquila as an example of the rhetorical figure called Diaporesis or feigned
hesitation, which is thus defined—‘ Dmoassxs est addubitatio qua utimur
quum propter aliquas res volumus videri dubitare et quasi ab ipsis
iudicibus consilium capere quo potissimum genere orationis utamur.’

18. Negem illam rem agitatam. Classen and Baiter, following
A, Β, and other MSS„ read ‘negem esser illam rem agitatam.’ But
many MSS. omit ‘esse‚’ and rightly, for it could scarcely stand here,
unless it were intended to denote present time in opposition to ‘fuisse ¹
in the first clause. The ‘infamia’ might be said still to exist, while
all the other circumstances mentioned belong to a remote period.
Hence we might read without impropriety—‘negem esse illam infamiam
. . . negem fuisse illam rem? δια, but not vice versa.

concionibus . . . iudiciis . . . senatu. Observe that public
speaking of all kinds is here indicated, while the verbs ‘agitare . . ,
iactare . . . commemorare’ denote, to a certain extent, the style appro-
priate to the different audienees. The ‘ conciones ’ are the public meet-
ings called by the Tribune Quintius, the ‘ iudicia’ are the various trials
which followed the condemnation of Oppianicus, ‘ senatu ' the proceed-
ings in the senate with reference to the same affair—all of which are
fully detailed in the course of this speech.

¹9· Evaunum, &c. The belief or prejudice is here compared to
a tree with large, deep-struck, old roots. No epithet is unnecessary—
‘tantam’ implies that the roots were large and strong—⁸ penitus in-
sitam) that they had penetrated deep into the ground-‘vetustam'
that they had been long there, and therefore adhered firmly. The
roots might have been large and strong without going deep, they might
have been strong and deep without having been long attached to the
spot, as in the case os a transplanted tree, but being at once ‘large,’
‘ deep,' and of ‘'long-standing‚' they must have clung close and been
hard to eradicate.
