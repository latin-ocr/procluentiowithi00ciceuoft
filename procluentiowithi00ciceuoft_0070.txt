58 INTR OD verrom

termination of ‘multitudini‚’ and the commencement of “

‘nemini‚’ and that 1N1 occurs immediately afterwards.
Hence some transcriber, whose eye had become confused,
dropped out one IN, and the whole then became—

MVLTITVDINEMINILICITVM.

which, when the words were divided, would appear as—‘ mul-
titudinem inilicitum,’ and this would at once be corrected
into ‘multitudinem inlicitum‚' a combination perfectly satis-
fac'tory as far as the mere words are concerned‚ but destitute
of sense.
