considerable importance on the same site, which is the fmntier town
of the Papal territory towards that province of Naples known as the ἕ

Abruzzo Ultra. This Asculum is chiefly celebrated in Roman history
as the place where the standard of revolt was first raised by the Italian
States in the Social war, 90 13.c. Thus Velleius (ι. 15)

‘Quippe L. Caesare et P. Rutilio oonsulibus, universa Italia, cum id
malum ab Asculanis ortum esset, quippe Servilium praetorem Fontei-
umque legatum occiderant, ac deinde a Marsis exceptum in omnes
penetrasset regiones, arma adversus Romanos cepit?

It was besieged and taken, after an obstinate resistance, by Q. Pom-
peius Strabo, when Consul, 89 B.c., who treated the inhabitants with
all the cruelty which charactexized the struggle. His triumph is
recorded in the Fasti Capitolini as having been celebrated at the end
of December in 89 uc. Cn. Pomms Srmo Cos. DE Ascuumms

Asculum Picenum must be carefully distinguished fmm Asculum in
Apulia, on that branch os the Via Appia which led to Canusium, hence
termed Asculum Apulum, now called Ascoli di SatrianQ and also
celebrated in Roman history, on account os the great battle fought in
the vicinity with Pyrrhus 279 nc.

8. Inter sicarios. This is a technical expression to denote ‘the
court where cases of assassination were tried.’ So below, 53, ξ 147
‘ Haec quaestio sola ita gubernatur? quid M. Plaetorii et C. Flaminii
inter sicarios ‘?’ Μ. Plaetorius and C. Flaminius being the judges who
presided in the court where assassins were tried. We have the phrase
more sully in De Finn. 2. 16 ‘An tu me de L. Tubulo putas dicere?
qui, quum Praetor quaestionem inter sicarios exercuisset.' See also Pro
Rosc. Am. 32, Philipp. 2. 4.

15. Venit index . . . neque obscurus neque incertus. ⁶ Obscurus’
refers to the personal character os the ‘ index,' ‘incertus' to the nature
of the information which he supplied. He was a known man (non
obscurus), therefore his statements could be believed, and these state-
ments were distinct and unequivocal.

22. Quem tamen unum. ‘Tamen’ is found in A, B, C, E, and
many other MSS„ some have ‘tum‚’ others ‘tantum-⁹ ‘Tamen' is
undoubtedly correct-Dinaea represented to her relations that, bereaved
as she was, yet, after all, one son was left, and him she implored them
to seek out and restore to her. We fmd the same use of ‘tamen’ in the
Divinatio 15, ξ 4² ‘At ne is quidem tantum contendet in dicendo quan-
tum potest, sed consulet laudi et existimationi tuae: et ex eo quod ipse
potest in dicendo aliquantum remittet, ut tu tamen aliquid videare '--
i. e. ‘that you, weak as you are, may after all appear to be something.¹
