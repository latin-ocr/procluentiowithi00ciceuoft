 

§5 ιο-ιι, worm. 153

—1. ‘Renown’ or ‘distinction.'—2. ‘An empty m‘aving aster renown
or distinction: and hence ‘ gloriari? to boast.

19. A. Cluentius Habitus. With regard to the name of the de-
fendant, see note on the title of the speech.

20. Municipii Larinatis. Larinum, the ruins of which now bear
the name of Larino vecchio, was situated about twelve miles from the
Upper Sea, on the right bank of the Tifernus (Biferno), which divided
Apulia from the country of the Frentani. lt appears certain, however,
that this elan must have founded, or, at least, at one time, possessed
larinum, since the inhabitants are styled by Pliny (H. N. 3. 16)
‘Larinates cognomine F rentani.’ Silius Italicus describes its position

(¹5· 565)-

‘ Quaque iacet Superi Larinas accola Ponti,
Qua duri bello gens Marrucina, fidemque
Exuere indocilis sociis Frentanus in armis?

21. Virtute, existimatione, nobilitate. The first of these words
denotes ‘high principle' and its effect ‘probity’-—the second, ‘the
reputation enjoyed by an individual among his fellow—men ’—-the third,
simply ‘high birth’ or ‘a high social position.' A man might have
⁸ Virtus’ and yet not enjoy ⁴ Existimatio,’ and viee versa; a man might
have both without being ‘ nobilis: and might be ‘ nobilis ’ without having
either.

2². Sulla et Pompeio oonsulibus. He refers to the consulship of
L. Cornelius Sulla and Q. Pompeius Rufus, 88 13. c.-Hence the younger
Cluentius was born ¹03 n.c.—-The epoch is remarkable. In 88 ae.
the Social war was brought to a close, the first Mithridatic war com-
menced‚ the civil strise between Marius and Sulla burst forth, and the
first proscription took place.

1 am surprised that Classen should. on the authority of A, B, and
one or two other MSS„ have admitted into his text the form ‘Sylla‚'
which is completely at variance with the principles of Roman ortho—
graphy. C has uniformly ‘ Sulla!

25. consobrino suo. ‘Her first cousin! The children os two
sisters were termed, in relation to each other, ‘consobrini' or ‘con-
sobrinae ’—the children of two brothers, or, os a brother and sister,
‘Amitini (ae).’

26. Ut tum habebatur. ‘Tum’ is emphatic—his character stood
high at that time, afterwards it sunk.

3¹· Nominis causa. So the great majority of MSS. and edd. A,
Β. and one MS. os Lambinus have ‘in omni causa,' and are followed
by Lambinua Classen, and Baiter. Sch‘itz omits the words altogether.
