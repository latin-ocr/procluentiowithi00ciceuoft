hostility to the wishes and interests of anotherz ‘inimicus‚' personal

Pl.) 77.y l. ῐ. Atque audacissimi. These words are omitted in A,
and bracketed by Baiter. ‘Audacissimi’ is as likely to have dropped
out aster ⁸ avarissimi ' as to have been interpolated.

4. Neque enim. A, B, omit ⁸ enim! It is retained by Classen, and
bracketed by Baiter.

' 5. Animum inducere. So A, B, and the great majority of MSS.
A few have ‘in animum‚’ which was adopted by most edd. before
Classen, and is in itself unexceptionable‚ although quite unnecessary.
Baiter, following Arusianus Messius, introduced ‘neque [enim] legare
quicquam eiusmodi matri poterat animum inducere ’—but quotations by
grammarians and others are always to be viewed with suspicion, as
authorities sor changing a received text.

8. Bona eius omnia ad matrem esse ventura. According to the
provisions of the Civil Law in the time of Cicero, the property of an
intestate, failing ‘Sui Heredes,' passed to his ὅ Consanguinei‚’ i. e. to his

Ἰ brothers and sisters by the same father. But a wife who married with
‘Conventio in Manum’ ranked, in the eye of the law, in matters of
inherstance, as her husband's daughter (loco filiae), and consequently as
the sister (loco sororis) of his children. Thus, Sassia had in law the
rights of a sister over the property of her son Cluentius, if he died
int-state. See Gaius 3. ξ 14.

9. Aucta pecunia. Classen is probably right in regarding ‘aucta'
as the nominative agreeing,with ⁴ quae.' He quotes in illustration Pro
Rosc. Amet. 3, ξ 8 ‘spoliis Sex. Roscii hoc iudicio ornati auctique
discedebant;’ and in Verr. Act. 2. 5. 31, §80 ‘Hac tanta praeda
auctus!

η. Ex municipio Aletrinate. Aletrium, written also Alatrium, as
in Greek Ἀλέτριον and Ἀλάτριον, was in the country of the Hernici.
a few miles to the north of the Via Latina, about ten miles due east of
Anagnia (Anagni), and six miles north of Ferentinum (Ferentino). The
modern town Alatri is chiefly interesting from the circumstance that
the walls which encompassed the ancient city and its citadel still remain
almost entire, presenting perhaps the finest and most perfect example
in existence of that very ancient and massive style of building which is
now generally termed ‘Polygonal ¹.' Arpinum (Arpino), the birth-place
of cicero, where also there is a fine Polygonal wall, lies about sixteen
