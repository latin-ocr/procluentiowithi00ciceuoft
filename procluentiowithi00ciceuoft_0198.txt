humour, seigning‚ as it were, that he believed him to be, or at all events}
had forgotten that he was not really a barbarian.

7. Hie isse planus. This word ⁶ planus’ is the Greek 'adunas
and signifies ‘a strolling vagabond, a cheat, an impostor! So Hor. ι,

Epp. 1. 17

‘Nec semel irrisus triviis attollere curat
Fracto crure planum ' . . .

And Aulus Gellius (16. 7), when enumerating a series of strange words ᾗ

   

introduced by Laberius into his Mimes, mentions this among others—‘ j
‘et planum pro sycophanta dicit: quamquam planum pro sycophanta-g '
Μ. quoque Cicero in oratione scriptum reliquit quam Pro eluctatio ’  ,

dixit: The word occurs in Petronius also (Satyr. 823. .
16. Quum palam. So a great majority of MSS. Most edd..
however, before Classen, adopt ‘quam‚’ which is scarcely admissible
here. ’.
2 5. Placuit repente pronuntiari, szmmr. A note of the Pseudo· Ἰ
Asconius on the concluding sentence of the first action against Verres.
will serve as a commentary on these words— = ‘J
‘Moris veterum fuit, cum satis visum esset fluxisse verborum, hanc-
sibi necessitatem finiendae orationis imponere, ut dicerent ad ultimum. <2
Dm 3 quod etiam, ab utraque parte oratione consumpta, ut in consilium ’>
dimitterentur, Praec01 soleret pronuntiare Dumium-r! ¹
From this we leam that each speaker, as he concluded his oration.
ended with the word Dm, and that when both parties had finished their ”’
pleadings, the crier of the court proclaimed aloud (monunrmxuz solebat) ἡ
Danaum, in order that the jury might now proceed to consider their Α
verdict (ut in consilium dimitterentur. See above, 20, § 55).
Canutius, believing that bribery was going on, but that the terms had ’ 
not yet been sully arranged, endeavoured to frustrate the scheme by μ
waiving his right of reply, and thus bringing the proceedings abruptly ,
to a close.
Most edd. of Cicero have ‘placuit repente pronuntiari. Iudices ’τί
dixerunt se id velle.’ But the words ‘iudices' and ‘se id velle' are -3
wanting in all the best MSS„ and have evidently been added by some ’-
transcriber who did not understand the technical force of Dnmmmr. ‘J
A, B, and several MSS. have ‘pronuntiare,’ but some others of good η,
note have ‘pronuntiari.' Classen first restored the text, although
Garatoni had previously approached very near to the truth. J
