C. Cassius were Consuls the year following. Α,

senate had devolved the same duty! The phrase ⁴ decernere in aliquem* ,
here signifies ⁸ to impose upon a magistrate the task of carrying into,
effect a decree of the senate.’ The senate had instructed L. Lucanus(
when Consul, to propose a law in terms of their resolution, but huf}
having failed to do this, they imposed the same task upon M. Lucullus ζ.
and· C Cassius, as pa1t of their duty sor the following year. τ
All MSS, except A, B have decreverit: which' 1s a manifest solecism.
The mistake arose from the ellipse of‘ tulerint' after M. Lucullus εἴ
C. Cassiusss the transcribere. fancying that‘ decreverit’ was required to?
correspond with‘ tulerit? Lambinus made the necessary correction, but*
‘decreverit’ was the common reading until the ed. of Classen. j

with reference to that circumstance which you maintain was brought«
about by the money of Habitus. f
25. Vel tenuissima. This is a misprint. It ought to be ‘ullv'
tenuissima‚' which is the reading of all MSS. ‘ Ulla vel tenuissima' is κέ
conjectural emendation adopted by Ernesti and Orelli. f*

‘perserffendum Orelli, who adopts ¹:referendum interprets it, ‘denuda
