was QVoconius Naso ¹, and that he held the office of ‘ Iudex
Qaestionis‚’ which we have above² rendered by the expres-
sion Assistant Judge. Our information with regard to the
officials who bore this title is very limited, but it may be
useful to state briefly what we actually know, especially as
several scholars have freely propounded vague conjectures, as
if they were ascertained facts.

After the institution of ‘Qaestiones Perpetuae‚’ criminal
¹ business increased with such rapidity that the Praetors, who
were the ordinary presidents of these standing commissions‚
were unable to dispose of all the cases submitted to them, and
the appointment of assistant judges became necessary. Al-
though Sulla augmented the number of Praetors from six to
eight, crime extended in a much greater ratio, insomuch that
not only did the number of Qaestiones exceed the total
number of Praetors, but it became necessary to divide the
administration of one Qaestio among several judges ³. Thus,
for example, at the time when this speech was delivered, we
learn, from the words of Cicero himself, that at least three
judges were required to administer the ‘Lex Cornelia,’ under ¹
which Cluentius was tried. Two of the Praetors‚ M. Plae-
torius and C. Flaminius, took cognizance of trials for
assassination‚ ‘inter sicarios,' while QVoconius Naso was
charged with carrying out that portion of the law which re-
lated to poisoning and judicial conspiracy. The appointment

¹ The opinion entertained by some that two judges presided at this
trial, the one Q Naso, a Praetor, the other, Q‚Voconius, ‘Iudex Quic-
stionis,’ is so entirely at variance with everything we know regarding the
constitution and practice of the Roman criminal courts, that it would be
a waste of time to discuss it. ² Introd„ Sect. 1.

⁸ Probably four Praetors only before the time of Sulla, and six after
his reform, were available for criminal business. It has been supposed
that the Praetor Urbanus and the Praetor Peregrinus had each a Qaestio
assigned to him; but the immense increase in the number of citizens
which took place after the Social War, and the rapid extension of the
foreign relations of Rome, must have given rise to an amount of litiga-
tion which would afford full employinent to the civil judges‚ without the
addition os ordinary criminal cases.
