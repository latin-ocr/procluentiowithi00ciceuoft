Is we omit ‘gladium' we must apply ‘stilum' from the preced a
c ause.

26. Unum denirme aliquod. B omits‘ aliquod: which -15 retain εξ
by Clas sen, and brackete'd by Baiter.
30. Auctoritatem censorum. This· 15 the common reading, but Α,
Β, 811(1 8 large number of MSS. have‘ censoriam, ’and it is extremely·
probable that‘ censorum’ is the correction of some transcribet who
was startled by the· illorum’ which follows. 01855. and Bait. have, ἔ
“881150118111.’ › ἶ
P. 111.1. 1. Municipfl 11181111 5118. So Α, Β, class„ 81111 Bart- “
and this reading' 1s certainly more emphatic than‘ municipii 5111, ’which Ι
15 found· 111 811 other MSS and m edd. before Classen. ’
7. Pecuniam pro abortione. A, and the Cod. S. Vict. have alone ,
preserved this, the true reading, which was first adopted in the second
ed. of Lambinus. Almost all the other MSS. and most edd. have· pro ’
potione.' The hideous story is narrated in Chapter 12, where the
money given is termed‘ merces abortionis? ⁷
11. Privigno suo quaereret. So all MSS. and edd. except A, 3,- 1
01855, and Bait„ who have‘ dare vellet' instead of ‘quaereret.· ·“’
16. Sive voluntas, aive opinio fuit. Here ‘voluntas' must signisy
‘a deliberate purpose or exercise of will: ‘opinio' ‘a fancy, 8 bel'
adopted without caresul consideration? J,
20. Ut gravissime dicam. So A. Β, 01855, and Bait.. 811ᾶ11118,
earlier edd. Most MSS. and recent edd. have ‘ dicant‚’ which is scarcely·-
intelligible. f
32. Aerarium reliquissent. This is the reading of several MSSJ,
and most edd. B, and many MSS. have ‘aerarium reliquisse sub- 1,,
scripserunt,' and so Class. and Bait. A has ‘ aer. rel. scripserunt!
But the verb ‘subscribere‚’ in the proceedings of the 08115015, wei J
not employed to denote a fact but a reason. The Censors placed a 111811»,
among the‘ aerarii’ (aerarium fecerunt—in aerarios referebant), aad
then they attached a written note to his name, assigning their reason. g
and this note was the‘ subscriptio. Hence such a phrase as‘ aerarium
reliquisse 5111)581·,1ρ58111111’ would be quite inconsistent with the established*
technicalities. A conviction that there was something irregulas' m tha
expression, probably led to the substitution in A, of‘ scripserunt· 525¹.-
‘subscripserunt' The note of Classen seems to me quite wild. Seez
above, note on 42, § 119.,
P.112.l.1.1nveniretur. So Α Β, 811(1 the great majority
MSS. but almost all edd. before 01855. have ‘reperireturl Such '⁷
correction is uncalled sor, and probably arose from the pedantry oft
some grammarian who considered the verb‘ reperior' more appropriate χ ι
111 this pass age. ’
