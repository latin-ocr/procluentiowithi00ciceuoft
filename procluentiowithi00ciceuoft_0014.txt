2 INTRODUOTION.

consequence of accidentally swallowing a cup of poisoned
wine intended for his friend, the younger Oppianicus ¹.

The prosecution was conducted by Titus Attius Pisaur-
ensis, of whose abilities Cicero speaks favourably in another
place², and the defence by Cicero, singlehanded‚ as he
expressly declares—‘ totam hanc causam, vetere instituto,

In the year 74 Β. c.‚ during the consulship of L. Licinius
Lucullus and M. Aurelius Cotta⁵, C. Verres being Praetor
Urbanus⁶, a certain Aulus Cluentius Habitus, a native of
Larinum (the defendant namely in the present suit), accused

to bribe the jurors, and that several had actually been bought

much Cicero might endeavour to give a colour to some facts, aud to slur
over others, we can scarcely believe that he would have ventured to nar-
rate what was positively false, when so many of his hearers could have at

once detected and denounced the fabrication.
