IN TRODUCTION. 57

consequently were more easily confounded. Thus, in Chapter
9, we have the simple expression—⁴ ex Novia infantem
filium’-this written continuously in capitals would be
EXNOVIAINFANTEFILIV‘. Now, ‘Novia’ being a proper name
not found elsewhere in this speech, a transcribet would have
doubts as to its limits; secondly‚ the F in INFANTIT: might
be readily mistaken for an E3 thirdly, the markvdenoting
M might be small and faint, and easily overlooked; fourthly,
the same character is used, with a slight modification, to
represent either N or VI. Hence we need not be surprised
to find that two MSS. have transformed INFANTIT: into
NEANTE (‘ ne ante ’), and two others into NEVITE (⁴ ne
vitae ’); but neither of these yields any meaning, and accord-
ingly one transcribet who found ‘ne ante,’ in order to make
sense, omitted the ‘ ne,' from which arose the reading ‘ quum
haberet ex Novia ante filium,’ while another discarded both
words, leaving simply ‘ quum haberet ex Novia filium.'

We may take another example from this speech in which
a corruption, considered hopeless, was introduced by a slight
and natural oversight in copying words written continuously
in capitals. A sentence in 47, § 130, long stood thus in all
known MSS„ and was given up as unintelligible.

‘ lactata res erat in concione a tribuno seditioso: incognita
causa probatum erat illud multitudinem illicitum est contra
dicere?

But on the discovery of the Turin Palimpsest the true text
was at once restored.

‘ lactata res erat in concione a tribuno seditioso: incognita
causa probatum erat illud multitudini: nemini licitum est con-
tra dicere ⁹—which, be it remarked, exactly coincides with the
conjectural emendation proposed by Antonius Augustinus.
Now, if we write three of the above words continuously in
capitals it will be seen at once how the corruption arose—
