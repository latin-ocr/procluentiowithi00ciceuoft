of an assistant judge in one or more of the courts thus
became indispensable, and the title bestowed upon such a
functionary was ‘Iudex Qaestionis¹.’ On the following
points we have satisfactory evidence :—

1. The ‘ Iudex Qaestionis' discharged the same functions
and possessed the same powers in his court as a Praetor.
This seems to be clearly established by the terms in which
Cicero addresses QVoconius Naso in the Chapter quoted
above, and also in the account given in this speech of the
proceedings of C. Junius on the trial of Oppianicus.

2. The term ‘Qaesitor’ might be applied to either, and
both were said ‘quaerere’ or ‘exercere quaestionem,’ or
‘quaestioni praesse,' but the title ‘ Iudex Qaestionis’ was
confined to the assistant judge, and never applied to a
Praetor3 at least no example can be quoted in which a
Praetor is so designated; while, on the other hand, we not
only know that persons not Praetors held the office of
‘Iudex Qaestionis,’ but that in legal and formal documents
the two offices are specially distinguished from each other.
Thus C. Iunius, who acted as ‘Iudex Qaestionis’ on the
trial of Oppianicus, never attained to the praetorship (29),
and M. Fannius, who presided as Praetor at the trial of
Roscius of Ameria, had previously held the office of ‘Iudex
Qaestionis’ (Pro Rosc. Amer. 4). Again‚ the offices are
distinguished in a passage quoted by Ulpian (Coll. LL. Moss.
1. 3) from this very ‘Lex Cornelia’—‘18 PRAETOR IUDEXVE
QUAESTIONIS CUI SORTE OBVENERIT QUAESTIO DE SICARIIS'
—and in an inscription (Orell. 3827) we find that a certain
Tappo had held all the ordinary magistracies from the]
praetorship downwards, and had also been a ‘Iudex Qaeq
stionis’—C. APPULLEIUS. M. F.2 ΤΑΡΡο. PR. ΑΕΒ. T R. PL.

¹ That the office of ‘Iudex Qaestionis’ existed before the time of

Sulla is proved from Cic. pro Rosc. Amet. 4, 5.
² This inscription was found at Aquileia; but Ι cannot agree with Bertoli

in thinking that the title ⁸ ludex Qaestionis' here refers to a muuicipal office«
