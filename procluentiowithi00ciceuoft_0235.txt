, J nihil aliud· ought to form the commencement, of chapter 53. ‘Com-
ζ movet’ is, however, the reading of C, and is retained by Baiter.
-. In these sentences, A, B have ‘luisset actum‚’ and A, B, C, ‘obtine-
remus‚’ instead of ‘ esset actum ' and ⁸ obtinerem,’ which are the readings
f. ol all other MSS. The latter is unnecessary, but the former seems to
3¹⁴ ’,ς be required here, the meaning being—‘it there had been no other object
ξ in view except to gain this case.’ Baiter takes the opposite view, t'or he
ξ reads ¹ esset actum' and ⁴ obtineremus! v
ξ, ” 1³. 121. 1. 5. Mens . . . animus . . . eonsilium . . . sententia.
*- j Although it may be difficult in many cases to define the exact force of
. v some ot these words, it would appear that, strictly speaking, ‘animus’
, eomprehends all the intellectual powers generally; ‘mens’ is more
, especially ⁶ the reasoning faculty ;' ¹ eonsilium? ⁸ a fixed plan or purpose,’
the result ot thought and reasoning; ‘sententia,' ‘a mental conviction
³ expressed in word or deed.’
11. Q.. Naso. See Introd. § 9.
20. Quasi mente quadam regi legis. Orelli approves of the
, explanation oi Weiske-⁶ Verbum mente bis est cogitandum, mente
quadam, legis sc. mente ¹—but this is by no means correct. Cicero
means to say, that as the bodies or actions os men are regulated and
controlled by their ‘ Mens’ or reasoning faeulties, so the proceedings of
} this and every other trial are regulated and controlled by ‘ Lex? ‘ Lex'
is to ⁸ Iudicium ’ what ⁴ Mens ' is to ⁴ Homines! The correct translation
os the passage is therefore—‘I hold that the whole of this trial is
, regulated and controlled by the Mind, is 1 may so call it, os Law.'
ι ‘Quadam' is introduced merely to qualify the somewhat startling ex-
ᾗ pression ‘ mente legis!
, 22. Inter sicarios. See above, note on 7, ξ 21.
²5· Reliquae quaestiones, i. e. ⁸ De maiestate, De salsis: &c.
ν 27. Apud me, i. e. ‘in my court‚’ in the court in which Ι act as

jndge in cases ‘ De Repetundis?
J , 31. Quid agam. ‘Mark what is being done.’ i.e. what the object
⁴ and scope os this argument is-to what the recognition oi this principle
μ, will lead. So below, 55. ξ 152 ‘Nec quiequam agitur, mihi credite,
’ iudices . . . nisi ut,' &c.‚ and above. 53, ξ 145 · Quodsi nihil aliudiuisset
' actum? i. e. · If 1 had had no other object in view.’ See also 56, ξ 153;
