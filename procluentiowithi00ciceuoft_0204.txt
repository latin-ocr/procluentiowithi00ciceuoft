subiicitur: aut enim Cnmmmun, aut Pnanvmcmrtm, aut Taum ζ,
SANTUR. 1. Cumanum est salsa crimina intendere: 2. vafflc ·--’
vera crimina abscondere: 3. TERGWERsmu (in universum) ab accusation J
desistere? ,⁶ .

26. Iam id quoque, &c., ie. ⁸ even if we were to admit this to be a true:
version of the story, your case would be as bad as ever; for to employ. ;
money sor the purpose of inducing an accuser to compromise his im· ¹,
peachment, is in reality an act of judicial corruption as much as the act*
of bribing jurors? Baiter has ‘ nam id’ upon no satisfactory authority. ’

28. sequestre. See note on 8, ξ 25, and compare 26, ξ 72. .

31· Amicum necessariumque communem. Properly speakingsf
‘ necessarius ' seems to denote a person closely and intimately connected ² J
with another upon terms of equality, but not by any tie of blood or
marriage. Thus, in 34, 5 94--‘ Sulla maximis opibus, cognatis, affinibus, ⁴³
necessariis, clientibus plurimis '—‘ necessarii’ are distinguished from ζ’
‘cognati‚’ ‘ affines,’ and ‘clientes.' The connection subsisting between ,, ,
‘ necessarii’ was called ‘ necessitudo? See 42, § 117.

3²· Sed quid ego . . . disputem. So all MSS. except A, B, thch 2
have ‘ disputo.’ Classen argues strongly in favour of the latter, but the , '
matter is scarcely. worth discussion, no point of meaning or criticism ³
being involved. ‘ Quid disputo ’ will signify, ⁴ Why do 1 discuss?' ⁸ Quid J
disputem‚' ⁶ Why need Ι discuss?' z

P. 96. l. 3. Ad quam rem fuerit. Many MSS. have ⁸ ad quam rem ¹
data fuerit,' but ‘data' is omitted in A, B, E, and several others. It ’
would be an unnecessary and disagreeable repetition of ‘ data est’ in
the line above, and has all the air of an interpolation. ,,

8. Quadragena millia nummum. A, B, omit ‘nummum’ here, “
retaining the word, however, above in ‘quadraginta millia nummum? ’1
We may remark again (see above, 7, § 22), that the greatest confusion -χ,
prevails in MSS. wherever numbers occur, arising in all probability
from the circumstance that these in the oldest copies were invariably - 
expressed by symbols and not by words. Mistakes would constantly
arise among careless and ignorant transcribers both in copying these ψ
and in translating them into words, the difficulty being much increased
by the highly elliptical forms of expression commonly employed in
computation. Here the insertion or omission of ‘nummum' (IIS) is ·:
a matter of perfect indifference. ,g
» 10. Demi-ibere. There is a sort of pun on the word ‘describere,' ·.
for while it signifies ‘to divide or distribute or mark out for distribution:
it is also employed technically to denote ‘the drawing of diagrams'
by mathematicians; e. g. Livy 2 5. 31 ¹ Archimedem, memoriae proditum - 
est .. ‚int‹ ntum formis, quas in pulvere descripserat, ab ignaro milite ⁴
quis esset interfectum! ’
