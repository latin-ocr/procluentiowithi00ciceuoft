any particular trial, it is in every case a trial for murder. But
it would be very unsafe to draw any general conclusion from
data so limited.

SECT. 10.—0n the peculiar personal dffculties «with which Cicero
had to contend in conducting the defence φ’ Cluentius.

Cicero fully admits that the conviction of Oppianicus had,
at the time when it took place, been almost universally re-
garded as the result of a foul mercenary conspiracy, and that
Cluentius the prosecutor, Junius the presiding judge, and
several of the jurors, had, in consequence, become objects of
popular detestation. He was precluded from now treating
this summarily, as a mere unfounded and empty clamour, for
he had himself, on several occasions, to suit his own purposes,
spoken in the strongest language of the infamy of the ‘ Iudi-
cium Iunianum,’ and of those connected with it, and this
not only in general terms, but also with reference to certain
specific acts.

We have seen, in sketching the general plan of the defence‚
Sect. 3, that the orator had three great objects in view-
He sought to demonstrate‚—1. That Oppianicus had been
most righteously condemned. 2. That it was contrary both
to fact and to reason to suppose that Cluentius had resorted
to bribery. 3. That the outcry against Junius, and against
some of the jurors, especially C. Fidiculanius Falcula, was
unjustifiable. But upon every one of these points he had
previously committed himself.

1. As to the disgraceful character of the whole business.
In the first action against Verres he embodies the thoughts
and plans of Hortensius, and other supporters of Verres, in
these words :—

‘ Iudex est M. Caesonius, collega nostri accusatoris, homo
in rebus iudicandis spectatus et cognitus: quem minime ex-
pediat esse in eo consilio, quod conemur aliqua ratione cor-
rumpere: propterea quod iam antea, quum iudex in Iuniano
consilio fuisset, TURPISSIMUM 1LL1JD nemus non solum
