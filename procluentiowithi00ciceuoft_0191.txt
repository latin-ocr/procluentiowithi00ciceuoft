’ It is to be observed that ⁴ accusationi’ is found in all the best MSS„

2 but in no other passage does Cicero use a dative after ‘praevaricari’

>³Hence Orelli and Baiter are fully justified in placing ‘accusationi '
within brackets,

For examples of the phrase ‘facere sedulo: meaning ‘to exert one’s
aelf, to do one’s best,’ see Terent. Eun. 2. 2, 71, Adelph. 3. 3, 39, Cic.
de Finn. 3. 4, ξ 16.

2 ‘Praevaricari’ is here employed with reference to a pleader who
betrays the cause he had undertaken to defend. See note on 32, § 87,

’.ἑ *with regard to the proper meaning of the word.

P. 83. l. 5. De illo loeo, i. e. ‘in connection with that stale and

⁴ hackneyed appeal, ‘⁶ Respieite iudices.”’ Here ‘ Locus' means ‘ a

” commonplaee.'

11. De Oppianici eausa. So nearly all the MSS. and edd. except A,

’ B, the Cod. S. Vict„ Class.‚ and Baiter, who have ‘de Oppianici persona

·Ῑ αυεεςυεῖ Classen remarks—⁶ Causa spectat tentatum ab 'Oppianico in
Cluentium veneficium ; persona ea omnia complectitur quae de vita
js Oppianici anteacta praemissa erant ⁷——which is quite true if we assume

43⁶3&th ‘ persona' really belongs to the text. But it is obvious that such a

word was much more likely to have been interpolated than to have

⁷ τ’* dropped out, and since it is omitted in a great majority os MSS. it must
be regarded with suspicion. With regard to the phrase ‘Oppianici
persona: see what is said below in the note 29, ξ 78, on the words

’ · Huius Staieni persona.’

13. His duobus praeiudiciis. Here ‘praeiudicium ’ is employed in
its strict etymological signification, and means ‘a previous decision :⁹ .
so again a sew lines lower down, ‘nullo praeiudicio factos and § 62
‘duo praeiudicia3' and 25, ξ 68 ‘ duobus iugulatum praeiudiciis?

14. Fabriciorum. Cicero habitually speaks of the ⁶ F abricii,'

, although one only, C. Fabricius, had been concerned in the proceedings
with regard to Habitus (nam L. erat mortuus 16, ξ 47), and by using
*the plural probably intends to include Scamander.

15. Locus ei primus, &c. See note on 20, ξ 56.

17. Nune omitto. The word ‘nunc’ is omitted in Β, and placed
before ‘ego omnia' in A. Baiter brackets it.

25. 1111 sua per ιο ipsi iudicia rescinderent. It will be remarked
that Cicero designedly chooses to take it for granted that the connection
os Oppianicus with Scamander was an undoubted and established sact-
Baiter brackets the words ‘per se? but they seem to be found in all

28. Quia oon-eim. A, Β, have ‘conscius esset,’ and so class.

‘nie wordhad much better be lest out.
