ἧς ¹40-142· NOTES. 22 t

' A proposal to lead a second colony to Narbo was made by Crassus
ν the orator somewhere about 111 n.c., but a ‘ rogatio‚' supported by the

Ῐ J senate, was brought in to oppose the measure, and on this occasion
ἐ ’,ν Crassus did all in his power to depreciate the authority of the senate.
j He succeeded in carrying his point, and the colony was accordingly led
⁷ g forth by himself. These facts are established by comparing the passage

ξ ‚² before us with Brut. 43, 5 160.

A. 16. In suasione logis Serviliae. This was a law proposed by Q.
¹ Servilius Caepio, Consul along with C. Atilius Serranus 106 Bc,

; , mering that the right of acting as jurors on criminal trials‚ which had
η » belonged to the Equestrian order exclusively since the passing os the
- ι 'Lex Sempronia' in 122 mc„ should be divided between the senate and

Equites. If the ‘ Lex Servilia Iudiciaria’ was actually passed, which is
Γ uncertain, it must have remained in force for a very brief period. See

¹ 2 Brut. 43, ξ ιόῐ.

1 19. Illorum iudicum, i.e. ‘the jurors of that period,’ viz„ the
- members of the Equestrian order.

J P. 119. l. 4. Honeste scribere, i.e. ‘with deceney.’ Cicero himself
· tells us (De Off. 1. 35, 129) what the practice of his countrymen in
ζ these matters was-

. ‘Nostro quidem more cum parentibus puberes filii, cum soceris generi
² non lavantur.⁹

ι Cum id aetatis filio. Remark the curious elliptical idiom. So we
“ find elsewhere in Cicero—⁸ tamen ita viximus et id aetatis iarn sumus’—-

, ” ‘id aetatis hominem longo sermone retinere!

Ἰ 5. Eas se tamen. A, B, omit ‘se‚' and so class. There is un-
,Ι doubtedly an awkwardness in employing ‘ se' here, referring as it does,
- to a person different from the one indicated by ‘se’ in the -clause

’ : immediately preceding.

6. Libris . . . tabulis . . . censu. Here ‘libri' are the books of Brutus

in a literary sense3 ‘ tabulae' are his books in a mercantile sense;
⁸ censu' the registration of his property, the books of the Censor.

’ 8. Se in iis orationibus reprehensum. Observe the soree of ‘in'

, in this clause—that he had been censured ‘on account of expressions
employed in those speeches’ which he had delivered upon public

matters—‘de republica’ is ernphatic; Cicero wishes to imply that want

j: of consistency injudicial orations was a matter os no consequence.
s ,

η. Tempore . . . causa. He refers here to the Verrine Orations.
πο. 81 quam hue graviorem, &c. So all MSS. except Α, Β, which

’,Ῐ have ‘ huic.' which will depend upon ‘ graviorem! Classen. who adopts
’,  this reading. argues that ‘gravior opinio’ taken absolutely cannot
signisy ‘an unfavourable opinion: but few scholars will doubt that such
