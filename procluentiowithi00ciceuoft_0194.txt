by the tautology‚ for, from Graevius to Orelli inclusive, they punctuate⁴
the clause thus—‘ donis, datis, muneribusque. ⁹
25130 fautore. So A, Β, and a few other MSS„ and so Class aad
Baiter. The greater number of MSS. and edd. have‘ auctore‚' whi ’
commentators explain by‘ defensore: but Classen seems to be ugni
when he asserts that no example can be quoted from any good author,
in which a juror disposed to favour an accused person is termed the ’
‘ auctor’ of that person. j
28. Ne sua quidem. Because he slunk out of court without„

P.87. 1. 6. Causam bonorum Saflnii Atellae. With the excep· 3'
tion of the information afforded by this passage, and a cursory allusion4
below (36, ς 99) to the‘ iudicium Safinianum‚' we know nothing of the
cause here alluded to. As far as we can gather, we should concludes
that the father of Safinius Atella died while his son was a minor: that :-
the guardians of the latter fraudulently disposed of the property
entrusted to them; that the young man impeached his guardians, andael
at the same time, to insure their conviction‚ placed a large sum in the⁴
hands os Staienus for the purpose of corrupting the jury; that a verdictg
was given in favour of the prosecutor, but that it was subsequently ’
discovered that Staienus had not distributed the money among the
jurors, but had applied it to his own purposes; and that, when}
detected, he had refused either to refund it to Atella or to make it over ¹
to those who had purchased the property from the guardians, aud who.f
being now obliged to restore it, were likely to suffer loss. g
16. Saluti desperare vetuit.. In the best writers the verb ‘despe- ’
rare ' is construed with the dative of the thing despaired of, or with the 1
accusative, or with the ablative and the preposition ‘de.' We mayn
with equal propriety say ‘desperare saluti,' or ‘desperare salutem: or
‘desperare de salute.' The word is also used frequently, absolutely,:'
without a case, in the sense ‘I arn without hope.'—In the phrase ἰζ’
Senatu desperare' (in Pison. 6.) the meaning is, ‘to have no hope of*
obtaining from the Senate.’ Ῐ
19. Negavit, quemquam esse . . . qui id efficere possit. So all ¹
the MSS„ with one exception, and so the earlier edd.—Ernesti, Orelli, “
and Baiter have admitted ‘posset,’ which is more in accordanoe
with the regular grammatical connection of the tenses. But ‘possit-2¹
imparts a certain vivacity to the narrative, since it presents Staienus...
speaking, as it were, before us. “
22. Invidiam atque offensionem. ‘Invidia’ here denotes ὼε
‘ill -will' of which a person is the object; ‘offensiofl some aet caleu- s
lated to produce ill- will' or enmity. ’
