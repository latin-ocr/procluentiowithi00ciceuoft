10. cognosceret. A B, and some other MSS. have ‘cognossetff
and so Class and Bait. The tense is a matter of indifference, altho 2³
‘cognosceret' is perhaps more sorcible‚ indicating‚ as it does, that the
resolution taken by Sassia was immediate—that there was no ιῐιοῐιιιέιιῑζ
of hesitation on her part. ’
11. Coniugii. The great majority of MSS. omit this word. It is>
bracketed by Classen, and lest out by Baiter. “
18. Quod m'si esset. A, B, have ‘quod si esset,’ and so Class„⁴
and Bait. ’
21. Scelere omni. A, B, have ‘ scelerum omnium,' and so Class. ¹
26. Bonis, muneribus. See note on 24, ξ 65. Classen remarks:⁴
that these two words are frequently joined, thus Pro Archia, 8, 5 18⁷*¹
¹ Quare suo iure noster ille Ennius sanctos appellat poetas, quod quasi
Deorum aliquo dono atque munere commendati nobis esse videantur! -
Some MSS. and several of the earlier edd. have ‘ donis muliebribus? .
which, in itself, is unexceptionable, for the ‘collocatio filiae’ and the s
⁵ spes hereditatis’ might be aptly termed ⁴ dona muliebria.' ι.
28. Ita quod, &c. This is found in the great majority of MSS, and
is more appropriate than ‘ Itaque‚' which appears in most edd. We have ’
⁸ ita quod' in the same sense at the end of Chapter 9. ”
P. 140. l. 10. Falsae conscriptiones quaestionum, i. e. the forged..v
depositions pretended to have been taken at the investigation into the
death of Oppianicus. ’
ι5. Romam misisset: ipsa. paullisper. So A, B. In most MSS. υ,
and edd. the words are arranged differently. ’ ,
ι7. Postea autem, quum. So all MSS. and edd. except A, B, Class„ γ
and Bait„ who have ‘postea autem quam.’ · q
22. Iam vero quod. iter Romam, ἃς. The route followed by⁴ ε
Sassia' ln her Journey from Larinum to Rome will be readily understood* ¹
by referring to any good map.. On leaving Larinum, she would soon j
join the cross road mentioned' 1n the Antonine Itinerary as leading from. ἒ
Teanum Apulum. through Geronium‚ to Bovianum, one of the most:
important towns in Samnium, a distance of forty-eight miles. From. ⁴³
Bovianum she would follow a branch of the Via Valeria northwards'?
to Aesernia, a distance of eighteen miles, from which there must have·
been some road or track, down the valley of the head waters of th a
Volturnus, to Venafrum on the Via Latina, whence she would pro *zm
through Aquinum, Fabrateria, Fregellae, and Anagnia to Rome.
24· Fabraternorum. The best MSS. have ‘Afratemorum,’ one · ⁴
two have ⁴ Fraternorum! Out of these some edd. make ‘Venafrano ν·- J Ι
others ‘ Fabraternorum,' of which the latter is to be preferred as 2 ι
proaching more nearly to the corrupt forms in the MSS. As far as⁴ · ” ¹
