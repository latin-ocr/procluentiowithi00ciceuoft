 

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

SEVERAL years ago I read the following passage in Nie-
buhr’s well· known ‘Letter to a Young Man who wished to
devote himself to Philology:’ —

‘For the study of language, 1 recommend you, above all,
Demosthenes and Cicero. Take the speech of the former
fhr the Crown, that of the latter pro Cluentio, and read them
with „all the attention you are master of. Then go through
them, giving account to yourself of every word, of every
phrase. Draw up an argument: try to get a clear view of
all the historical circumstances, and to arrange them in order.
This will give you endless work; and hence you will learn
how little you can, and consequently do yet, know. Then go
to your teacher‚—not to surprise him with some unex-
pectedly difficult questions (for in the speech for Cluentius
there are difficulties with regard to the facts which, even after
the longest familiarity with it, can only be solved by conjec-
tures, such as will not occur to the best scholar at the

⁴ moment), but that he may have the kindness to consider the
passageS‚ and to consult the commentators for you, where
your powers and means are at fault. construet a sketch of
the procedure in the accusation against Cluentius. Make a
list of the expressions, especially epithets and the nouns they
are applied to, and mark the key of the metaphors. Trans-
late passage& and a few weeks after, turn your translation
back into the original tongue. ¹ ’

¹ This translation' u, 1 believe. fmm the pen of that most accomplished
scholar and most amiable man, the late Archdeaeon Hare.
