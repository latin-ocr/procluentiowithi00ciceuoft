which, according to the latter, is the reading of A, Β. ‘Ex edicto ·

7. More Larinatium. Here we have at Larinum, nearly ἵνα,
thousand years ago, the fashionable wedding ddjedun· of our own
times. .-
9. Quum daretur. Observe the force of the tense—‘ when it ναι]
in the act of being administered! ,
18. Possunt P quod. A, B, have ‘ possint? id quod: and so Class. ;
and Bait. ‘T'
An ut de causa, &c., i. e. ‘did he desire, without lessening the
danger of his actual position, to lay himself open to a new charge 1)·
21. In illa frequentia? A, B, omit ‘ in‚’ and so Class. and Bait. ⁵
22. Gur non de integro autem datum? So, apparently, an Μ55.ἱ

this topic while Ι profess to refrain from speaking upon it. ,
25. Defendit. This is the reading of A, B, D, and most MSS. j
Some have ⁴ defendat;’ ‘defendet' is a conjectural emendation 0¹.
C. Stephens, adopted by Lambinus, but uncalled for.
29 Crufflor, i. e. ‘with a disordered stomach ' The modifications οἱ,
meaning which the word‘ crudus' undergoes are remarkable. ‘’Cr-udus ’
is properly the epithet applied to‘ raw undressed sood,' in opposition to
‘coctusss as in Plaut. Aul. 3. 2, 15 ψ

‘Quid tu curas utrum crudum an coctum edim?'

It is then used to denote food which remains uncooked, i. e. un·- ,η
digested, on the stomach, as in Juvenal, S. 1. 143 ⁴

‘Poena tamen praesens, quum tu deponis amictus
Turgidus‚ et crudum pavonem in balnea portas'—

and finally, it is applied to the organs whose digestive powers Μετ’141
impaired, as ‘cruda alvus' in Cato, or to a person suffering from de* χ
rangement of the digestive functions‚ as in the text. Moreover, the >³
word is applied figuratively in a great variety of senses, all of which*
can be readily deduced from the above. The idea os some grammarians ⁴
that it is etymologically connected with‘ cruor,’ seems fancisul.

Sibi tamen. Most, if not all MSS„ have· sibi tum? and so Class.'
and Bait. ‘'Tamen is certainly more emphatic and must be referred&
to‘ crudior’ — ‘disordered as he was, yet, as young men will do, 119
placed no restraint upon himself. Ἰ
