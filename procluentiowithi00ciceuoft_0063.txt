bly find that the MSS. not only differ widely from each other,
but that they are often inconsistent with themselves. Thus
we cannot feel certain whether the name of the personage
who is repeatedly mentioned as the agent of Oppianicus in
his judicial villanies was scalenus, or Stalenus, or Scaienus, or
Staienus, although the last is probably true, not to mention
Satagenus and some other varieties which are certainly blun-
ders. So the Senator, according to whose advice Cluentius
acted (19), may have been M. Baebius, or Bebius, or Baevius‚
or Bebrius; and one of the victims of Oppianicus, whose fate
is recounted in Chapter 13, is represented as Asuvius, Amius,
and Asinius. The same remark holds good with regard to
praenomina, which are omitted, inserted, contracted, and
varied in a most perplexing manner, and the confusion is of
course increased when two or more individuals are named
conjointly. Thus in 7, § 21, where we have printed—‘ M.
Aurium et Num. Aurium et Num. Magium,' we find the
following accumulation—‘M. Aurium et Numerium Aurium'
—‘ M. N. Aurius'—‘M. et N. Aurios’-—‘ Marium et N.
Aurios’--‘ Marcum et Numerium Aurios '-—-‘ Numerium Ma-
gium’—‘ Cn. Magium,’ Moreover, it sometimes happens that
a question of grammar is mixed up with a proper name, and
thus the complication is increased. Thus, in 16, § 40, where
we have printed ‘Aletrinate‚’ we may choose between that
and ‘Aletrinati,' ‘Alatrinate‚’ ‘Alatrinati‚’—besides which we
have the corruptions ⁴ Larinati' and ‘Alacrinate.’

CLASS IV.—Slight dffrences in the arrangement qs words not
⁴ producing any dfflrence qf sense.

A very large class of various readings. The following
examples are all comprised within the limits of a single
chapter (7) :—

§ 20. ‘ dubitatio ulla ’—‘ ulla dubitatio!
„ ‘scire volui vos '—‘ scire vos volui.’
2, ‘causam accusandi ’—‘ accusandi causam?
