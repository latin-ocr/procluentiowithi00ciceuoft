⁸ -ῗ 6. Ut ne sine Aelio, ι. e. Staieno. One MS. only, viz. Β, has
32· Aelio: all the lest have ‘ Staieno, ’ except C, which has ⁶ illo, ’ and this,
= {which has been adopted by Baiter, is probably the true reading. The
,ἔσοιπεε of corruption would be as follows :--the word to which‘ illo'
‘suffers being remote, some one, to prevent ambiguity, wrote‘ Staieno' in
f ‘file margin, then ‘Staieno' was substituted sor‘ illo· in the text by
‘trabsequent transcribers, until some one, more careful than his prede-
‘s-,msom being startled by the difference between ⁸ illo ’ in the oldest and
'‘·· A ‘Staieno ¹ in the more recent copies, introduced ⁶ Aelio’ as approaching
fyssgnore nearly to the former. Cicero, after what he said above (26, ξ 72),
was little likely to have employed the appellation ⁶ Aelius ' to designate
y personage.

28. Ex vetere illa disciplina iudiciorum, i. e. ‘who had been
,js trained in the good old school of courts where such corrupt practices
*T were unknown) The same phrase nearly is repeated in 38, ξ 107 ‘ex

-ζ 3²· Statuerunt, quo quisque animo, &c. These jurors believed
that Bulbus and Staienus had been bribed, but at the same time they
believed that Oppianicus was really guilty, and therefore, although
’ἶ influenced solely by the love of truth, resolved to give the same verdict
ἶξ as Bulbus and Staienus. They argued that the motives which led
ef different jurors to give the same verdict ought in each mse to be
³5.) scrutinized—· quo quisque animo quid fecerit spectare oportere.' Bulbus
:a and Staienus had voted right from bad motives, but this was no reason
why those who were pure should vote wrong.

9. Qui omnes rumorum et concionum ventos colligere con-

* tuomet. The language here is almost poetical. ‘ Quintius, a man who

ξ went all lengths with the democratic party, inasmuch as he had been

’ „ in the practice of gathering up all the flying reports blown about the
public meetings,’ &c. ‘Ventus' and ⁶ Rumor’ are used again in this
speech to denote what is implied here, ¹ the empty favour of the crowd.'
