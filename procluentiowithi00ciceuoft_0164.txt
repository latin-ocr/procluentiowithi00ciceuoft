client. Aulus Gellius, N. A. 5. 13, enumerat& the ‘Gradus' of ofi- ⁴

ficium which ‘ex moribus Populi Romani' were thus arranged— i

1. Parentes. —2. Pupilli. — 3 Clientes. ——4. Hospites. ——5. Cognati et ¹
Affines.

2. satisfacere. This word 1s omitted' m A, Β, is retained by Classen, ¹

and bracketed by Baiter.

7. Pro incolumi et vivo. Classen argues strongly ιιι favour of the ’

reading‘ et pro vivo, ’which is found in A, Β, and several other MSS.‚
and which has been adopted by Baiter. In the preceding clause we

have‘ contra damnatum et mortuum? and in the clause which we are ,
now discussing‘ incolumi’ is opposed to‘ damnatum,’ ‘vivo' to‘ mor· ‘-
tuum.¹ It would therefore destroy the symmetry of the antithesis if
we were to read‘ pro incolumi et pro vivo,‘ unless we were at the same j
time to introduce* contra damnatum et contra mortuum: which no one

would propose.

‘Incolumis’ here means ‘one who has never been found guilty of

a crime by a court ofjustice.'

9. Huic autem, pro quo dicitur . . . accedere. Such is the read- ⁷
ing of all MSS. and edd.¹ except A, B, Class., and Bait„ which have ””
‘hic autem, pro quo dicimus.. . accipere? The vulgate ought to be
retained. Classen argues that ‘ accipere‘ is more appropriate here than ‘³

‘ accedere ;' for Cluentius being ‘ incolumis‚’ the sear was that he might

now for the first time suffer damage, not that he might suffer additional s
damage, sor he was as yet intaet. But the ‘invidia’ under which ἡ·

Cluentius had so long laboured might surely be regarded as an ⁶ offensio’

(missortune), the term here used; according to this view there can be

no objection to ‘accedere,’ and we shall preserve the symmetry of the .
sentence—⁴ illi in quem dicitur . . . huic pro quo dicitur,' which is -·
destroyed by the reading in A, B. ⁵

1 1. Sine acerbissimo animi sensu ao molestia. So Α, Β, Class.,
and Baiter. All other MSS. and edd. have ‘ dolore' instead of ‘molestia.'
Classen supposes the change to have been introduced by some half-
learned transcribet who was offended by the adjective ‘acerbissimo’
applying to two substantives of different genders. But, on the other

hand, we might suppose ‘molestia’ to have been substituted by some 5⁴

transcriber who was offended by ‘doloris' and ‘dolore' in two eon—
secutive sentences. On the whole, the arguments in favour of ‘ molestia¹

are not of sufficient weight to overthrow the agreement of the great

majority of MSS.
14. Gloria, i. e. ‘vanity.' Observe the double meaning of ‘gloria.'

¹ Lambinus, however, has ⁸ accidet&
