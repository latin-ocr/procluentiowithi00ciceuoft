2 ,ι μ ·‘ng. to those cases only in which the misappropriation of money
ῑ ÷ · some public servant formed the main charge. Such were impeach-
·,”’ «πίε ‘De Repetundis' and ‘De Peculatu.' Is, for example, a Pro-
g ἰ -2 Governor was found guilty under the‘ Lex Servilia' of having
(¹ r· torted money from those under his sway, he was not only compelled
⁷ “ ι go into exile, but also to make restitution of what he had unlawfully
ζ Δ π The punishment was thus twofold. The' jury, after they had
¹ ’ν ought m their general verdict of guilty, proceeded to determine the
2' ¹¹⁴ ount to be refunded‚ and this was the‘ Litis Aestimatiol
⁴ L ii. ln fixing the sum to be resunded they were required to specify on
hat ground or score (quo nomine) each sum was fixed, stating the
ῑ· ⁴ :culars of the offence for which restitution was to be made.
’ iii. In performing this part of their duty, the jury had frequently an
2· ι ι -rtunity of modifying the punishment of the criminal. It is evident
ΔἈ· t when a charge was brought, generally ‘De Maiestate’ or ‘ De
· tundis: there must have been an infinite number of degrees of
J· ilt, and although each of these offences was nominally a ‘Crimen
‘⁷ v pitale: many cases might occur in which the amount of guilt was so
¹ sut 1, or the circumstances so extenuating, that the infliction os a
ἵ Poena Capitalis' would have been harsh and unjust. So, in our own
Α ,a person may be accused and found guilty of Manslaughter, but
ι· uis term comprehends all degrees of culpability between the extreme
=·'···t of an act of homicide verging upon wilful murder, and one in
’ hich the catastrophe rs the result of a slight imprudence. Hence the
= ent varies from penal servitude sor life to a mere admonition,
ιε amount of punishment, according to the practice of English courts,
, being determined by the Judge. Now, it would appear that the‘ Iudices,¹
' when they stated· 1n the‘ Litis Aestimatio’ on what score (quo nomine)
they fixed the amount to be paid, might make the offence appear of the
‚nost serious or most venial description, and they might even express
ι :themselves m such terms as to lay the eulprit open to a new impeach-
&eut sor an offence more serious than that for which he was under
Α ¹ ’νε 3 but, generally speaking, they were in the habit of leaning to the
3 side of mercy, and saving him from the penalties of a ‘Lis Capitalis?
ς ’ 'In point os fact, we may inser from the expression used in this chapter
⁵- with regard to Scaevola—‘omni contentione pugnatum est, ut lis haec
’ cupitis aestimaretur'—that when an individual was found guilty gener-
”³ ¹,ally of any offence which admitted of many gradations os gunt, it
¹ ’- depended upon the nature os the ‘ Litis Aestimatio' whether the ‘Poena'
⁴ was to be ‘Capitalis' or not, the Iudices discharging the duty which
&volves upon the Judge according to our system.
