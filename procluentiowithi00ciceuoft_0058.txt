’ Now, very many of these are palpable blunders, and,
besides, there are about twenty readings in the same ten
chapters so decidedly inferior that they are rejected by
Classen himself, while out of about twenty changes which
he has introduced within the same limits, Ι have endeavoured
to point out in the commentary that not above three at
most can be regarded as improvements.

The position of C, the Turin Palimpsest, is very different:
although the fragments extend over less than one-tenth of the
whole oration, we are indebted to it for the restoration of
two passages abandoned as hopeless by all editors (46, ξ 129 ;
47,§ 130), and in ¹7,§ 22, there can be little doubt that it
alone has preserved the true number (‘ CCCC millia ⁹). In
not one of these passages do A, B, afford the slightest
assistance.

Again‚ the Turin Palimpsest possesses extrinsic claims in
no way shared by A, Β. Although it may not be safe to
pronounce confidently on the precise century to which it
belongs, it is unquestionably by far the oldest MS. of -this
