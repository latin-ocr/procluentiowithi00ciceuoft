pascus who ‹leposited the property were said, technically‚ ‘sequestro
penei-e: or ⁸ in sequestro ponere‚’ and the property itself to be ‘ sequestro
positum’ or ‘in sequestro depositum! Thus Plautus, Rud. 4. 3, 70

TxAcu. ‘Tu istunc (se. vidulum) hodie non feres nisi das sequestrum
aut arbitrum,
Quoius haec res arbitratu fiat:-

tnd a few lines lower down—

Ttmcu. ‘Non probare pernegando mihi potes, nisi pars datur,
Aut ad arbitrum reditur, aut sequestro ponitur ’—
and again in the Mercator, 4. 3, 36
Dor. ‘Non tu scis quae sit illa? Lu. Imo etiam scio,
De istac sum iudex mptus. Don. Iudex! iam scio:
Huc tu in consilium istam advocavisti tibi.
Im. Iino sic sequestro mihi data est?
ln the time of Cicero, when political and judioial bribery had been
reduced to an‘ organized system, ⁸ sequestres’ were persons in whose hands
money was deposited by the bribers in trust sor the bribed, neither
party being disposed to rely upon the promises of the other. In this
sense it is used in the passage before us and in many others, e. g. In

,ἶ Verr. Act. 1. 12, and note os Ascon.; Pro Plane. 19.

By late wiiters ‘sequester’ is employed in the general sense of a
‘mtxliator,' as in Senee. Consol. ad Helv. 12, and this seems to be the
force os the epithet ⁶ sequestra ' applied to Pax by Virgil, Aen. 11. 133

⁴ Bis senos pepigere dies, et pace sequestra
l'er silvas Teucri mixtique impune Latini
Erravere iugis’.. .. .. .

Grammatically, we have ‘ sequester’ a substantive of the second and
also os the third declension, and ‘sequeste1·—1·a——rum,' an adjective.
The etymology is doubtful, at least it seems very difficult to connect the

‘' meanings which it bears with the verb ‘ sequi!

See Festus, p. 339, ed. Mulier, Aul. Gell. N. A. 20. 21, Modestia.
Digest. 50. 16, 110.

P. 09. 1. 2. vertebantur. So all MSS. and edd. except A, and Β,
which have ‘tenebantun¹ Classen argues elaborately in favour of this
reading, but 1 am unable to see any force in his reasoning. The
meaning affected by ‘terrebantur' is obvious and satisfactory. Baiter
follows Classen.

3. In causa iudicioque. The trial of Oppianicus.

16. Oppianici domum, viri eui sanguine redundantem. E omits
the word ‘domum‚' two Palatine MSS. have ‘dexteram' instead of
