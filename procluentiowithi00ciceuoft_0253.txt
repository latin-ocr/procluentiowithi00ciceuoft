’ 2 geography is conoemed‚ ‘Venafrum’ and ‘Fabrateria’ are alike un-

exoeptionable‚ but ‘Alfaternorum.’ which Graevius suggests, would lead
¹· us away to Nuceria Alfaterna (Nocera dei Pagani) on the Samus, near

s ,  Pompeii.

Δ P. 141. 1. 17. Quosdam alios deos. A peculiar body of deities,
’“ different from the gods whom men in general worship.

, ²9· Communi Italiae paee, in domesticis copiis esse totum.
,τ Orelli and many other edd.‚ in opposition to all MS. authority, read here
—‘in communi Italia pace, domesticis copiis esse tutum.’ Cicero must
= moen by ‘domesticae copiae’ the ‘women and children' (mulieres et

q pueri) of the population, and a town abandoned to their protection

exclusively might appropriately be said—⁶ in domesticis copiis esse
’ ἴοἳειιῐ.ι·0,,ιιοε tamen ipsos, i. e. the women and children.

Ι P. 142. l. 13. Lacrimis . . . lacrimantes. We can scarcely help
’- thinking that Cicero here goes too far in his attempt to enlist the
³ sympathies of his audience. Making every allowance for the excitable

’ temperament of the inhabitants of southern Europe, as opposed to the

’ phlegmatic coldness of the north, the picture os the mayor and aldermen

= os a provincial town dissolving into tears on such an occasion, must

, surely have appeared ludicrous even in a Roman court os justice.
17. Laudationem decretam. So A, Β. All other MSS. and edd.

f have ‘laudationum decreta.'

26. Res pecuniarias. This is the reading of all MSS. Orelli and
severas edd. have substituted ‘pecuarias‚’ a change quite uncalled sor.
It mnnot be said that ⁸ negotia ' implies the one more than the other.

, 30. Quam non abesse . . . Quam vellem praesentem posue. The
ι MSS. are here hopelessly corrupt. All, without exception, have ‘Quando
‚. abesse? and omit ‘Quam vellem‚' while the great majority have ‘possem'
’ ⁸ Quam non ’ is a conjectural emendation of some early editor. ⁸ Quam
Π vellem’ was introduced by Lambinus.

P. 143.1. 4. De eapite huius, quam de sua vita. Observe that
ὲ ‘mput’ and ‘ vita‘ are here placed almost in opposition to each other-—
>2 'apuu’ in its technical sense, denoting not the mere physical lise of an

⁷. individual, but the whole sum of his political and social rights on which

depended his ‘status’ as a member of the community to which he
belonged. The ‘vita’ of Rufus was in danger, but not his ‘caput.‘

’ Cluentius ran the risk of ‘deminutio capitis: but his life was not

'I ffizsstssedtgnimonio· A. Β, omit ⁴ in‚’ and so Class. Many MSS.

g have ‘et testimonio,' and many ‘et testimonium? Graevius, who is
