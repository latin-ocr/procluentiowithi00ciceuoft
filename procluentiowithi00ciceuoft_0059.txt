speech extant, probably at least five hundred years older than
even E, while A, according to Classen, belongs to the
fifteenth century, and he does not hint that B is older. Both
A and B seem to have been derived from the same archetype,
but B has been carelessly copied, and abounds in omissions.
It is curious that, although A contains thirty—two orations
and B seventeen, in no speech but that for Cluentius do they
present various readings worthy of attention.

SECT. 14.-—On the various readings in the speeches of
Cicero in general.

A young scholar who takes up what is called a complete
critical edition of a Greek or Roman writer, one, namely, in
which all the various readings supplied by MSS. and early
editions, or derived from conjecture, are enumerated and
discussed, when he observes that there is scarcely a line of
the original in which all our authorities absolutely coincide,
and that not unfrequently a clause of three or four words is
presented under half-a-dozen different forms, is apt to believe
that the text of the Classics is involved in doubt and con-
fusion, that we have no reasonable certainty that we are
reading a single sentence exactly as it issued from the lips of
the orator, or was indited by the pen of the historian, and
that we cannot even feel confident that the general scope and
force of their expressions have been correctly transmitted to
us. But upon more close examination he will discover that
his first impression is altogether erroneous, that the great
majority of the various readings are entirely destitute of
importance, that, of the remainder, many, although perhaps
occasionally involving some delicate point of grammar or
criticism, do not seriously affect the meaning of the passage
in which they occur, and that the residue, consisting of those
which produce a marked variation in sense, is, considering all
circumstances, wonderfully small. These, moreover, have
been so carefully sifted and winnowed by the patient labour
