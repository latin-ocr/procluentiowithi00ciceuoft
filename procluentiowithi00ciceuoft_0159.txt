ᾗ By the direct charges of poisoning preferred against Cluentius no one

² is endangered but himself (agitur A. Cluentii proprium periculum),

⁴ but is prejudice is allowed to have weight in courts of justice, then

J the sasety of the community at large is impen'lled (agitur causa

communibus). See below, 1, 5 4, ‘communi incendio‘ and note—and
8. 5 8, ‘communibus invidiae periculis? C has ‘ eorum omnium dis-

solutionem: but the common reading ⁴ omnem' is better.

-, 8. Inter vos disceptare. C, E, and several other MSS. have ⁴ nos‚'
ι which is adopted by Baiter, who quotes the following note from some
. mpublished papers of Garatoni :--

’ *3 ’ ⁴ Quaenam haec est iudicum inter se disceptatio? Ii vero tabellis tacite
sententiam ferebant neque inter se, verum inter accusatorem et reum
ἐξ disceptabant. Cf. Liv. 1. 503 Plin. Epp. 7. 15; De Inv. 1. 3. Quod
autem sequitur a nobis de Accio simul et Tullio dieitur: esset enim,
’ἶῖζ si de se tantum ipso a Tullio diceretur, absurdum. Legendum inter

nos, ut habet codex meus.’
, ⁶ Inter nos’ may be the true reading, but the reasoning of the Italian
2³- scholar is by no means eonvincing. It is quite true that the jurors

{¹¹ voted by balim, but this circumstance would not preclude discussion-—
-, and if we understand ‘ de nobis ' to refer to Cicero alone, the meaning,

 

far from being absurd, is at once clear and forcible. In a matter os

this importance, says the orator, do not rest satisfied with deliberating
”“” on what may be actually urged by me, but on what Ι ought to urge
'55⁸ were 1 capable of doing full justice to the subject. For (enim) this
  is a matter which does not affect the safety of an individual only, but
..⁵ os the whole community.

14. Fides imploranda. The ‘fides' of a juror was the integrity

and sense of honour which would prompt him to discharge his duty

³2 taithsully—the ‘religio’ of a juror was the obligation imposed upon

Ἰ’.[ἶῖ him by the sanetity of his oath. See below, 4, § 10, 42, ξ 118.

ι 5. Sine vestro ao sine talium virorum subsidio. So all the
MSS. (except oue bad codex which omits ‘sine’) and so all edd.
Classen, who retains the vulgate, remarks that commentators have
overlooked a serious difficulty existing in this passage, and considers
that some corruption lurks in the word ‘ac.’ ‘Vestro subsidio‚’ he
argues, means ‘the aid of you who are the jurors,’ while ‘tales vim'ss
which is a complimentary expression frequently applied by Cicero
to the members of a jury whom he is addressing’, must also refer

¹ Classen refers to Pro Qinct. 16, ξ 55, 26, ξ 81. Pro Rosc. Am. 19,
ς 54. Divin. in Q. caecil. 16, 5 51. To which wc may add, from this
speech, 68, 5 186.
