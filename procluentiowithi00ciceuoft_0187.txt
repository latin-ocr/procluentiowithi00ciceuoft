cannot avoid admitting that this circumstance is distinctly indicated in
two passages where there is no suspicion of any corruption. Thus, in
1‘1, 5 49 ‘Nam Cluentius, iudices, primum eius nomen detulit, cuius in
nauibus yenenum deprehenderat ;’ and again, 19, ξ 53 ⁸ M. Baebius . . .
‚⁷ ’ne praesente Scamandrum cum veneno pecuniaque deprehensum esse
’ dicebat! The truth seems to be that Scamander was seized at the
moment when he was in the act of giving the money and receiving the
poison in return. Nay, more; so sar is the vulgate from being
indefensible, that it appears to me that the force of the passage is
ζ’ entirely destroyed by the reading which Classen adopts. The money
without the poison would have been no proof of guilt at all, and it is
evident from the words of Cicero (18, § 50; 20, ξ 56) that the ‘ depre-
, hensio veneni' was the grand charge against Scamander, and this charge
> would have been destitute of weight is the poison had not been actually
found in his hands.
14. Quis apertior, i.e. ⁸ more evidently guilty.'
., 28. Integrum eonsilium. Here ‘consilium' denotes ‘a jury‚' i.e.
⁷ the whole body os jurors on a trial taken collectively.
“ ,ἰ simplex in iudicium eausa. Here ‘simplex causa’ denotes
fr? merely ‘a mse free from all intricacy.' There is no allusion to the
,rhetorical division of ‘Causae’ into ‘simplices’ and ‘coniunctae’ or
⁸ compostae! See Quintil. I. O. 3. 4.
¹ πε). Unum crimen. This is the reading of a great majority of the
MSS„ and is much more appropriate here than ‘verum,’ adopted by
Lambinus and many edd. upon no satisfactory authority.
32. Cum Aletrinatibus vicinitatem. See above, note on 16,
P. 79. 1. 7. Patroni omne perieulum. Of Fabricius, namely, who
‘ was the ⁸ patronus ’ os Scamander.
15. 1110 quidem Scamandrum. B and several MSS. omit ‘ quidem!
It is somewhat difficult to perceive what force the word has here.
24. semper equidem magno cum metu incipio dicere. Cicero
expresses himself more sully to the same effect in the Divin. 13, ᾗ 41
‘Ego, qui. sicut omnes sciunt, in soro iudiciisque ita versor, ut
eiusdem aetatis aut nemo aut pauci plures causas defenderint, et qui
omne tempus, quod mihi ab amicorum negotiis datur. in his studiis
laboribusque consumam, quo paratior ad usum forensem promptiorque
ase possim: tamen, ita deos mihi velim propitios, ut, curn illius
temporis mihi venit in mentem, quo die. citato reo, mihi dicendum sit.
non solum commoveor animo, sed etiam toto corpore perhorresco.⁸
27. Non possim implere. A, Β, omit ‘implere’ lt is retained by
classen, aud bracketed by Baiter. ⁴
