Classen argues that such an expression as ‘nominis causa,' i. e. ‘for ῙΪ
form's sake‚' would be altogether at variance with the sentiment which ἰ
the orator desires to express. His object is to bring the frantie wicked- «
ness of Sassia more distinctly before his audienee, by contrasting the ’
feelings and duties implied by the sacred name of mother with her ξ
atrocious conduct. He therefore declares that he is determined to give ⁷
her the title of mother throughout his pleading ‘in omni causa‚' albeit -

she is unworthy of the name—⁶ neque umquam illa ita de suo scelere et

immanitate audiet, ut naturae nomen amittat '—and then continues— ,

‘quo enim‚' &c.‚ ‘MAroRE omo 121on esst: nuce-ris!

All this is most ingenious and plausible, but I am not convinced, J‘ss.

for—1. Although the expression ‘in omni causa’ in the sense of ‘in

tota hac causa ' may be defended, this use of ‘ omnis ’ is certainly rare, ”
especially in Cicero. 2. ⁴ Nominis causa ² affords a plain and satisfactory “
meaning, notwithstanding the refinements of Classen. 3. ‘Nominis ᾗ
eausa’ was much more likely to be corrupted into the common and >
obvious form ‘in omni causa,’ than the latter into the former. 4. In· .
the first part of the sentence Cicero takes credit as it were for his sor·
bearance in consenting‚ even sor form's sake, to give her the appellation »ᾖ
of mother, and then adds that this forbearance on his part will in reality ’-

tend to make her guilt appear more odious.

P. 64.1. 5. Interfeetum eupit. Several MSS. have ‘cupiat‚’ but '
the indicative is required, for the clause ‘quae multos...cupit' is q

parenthetical, and contains a direct assertion on the part of Cicero.

9. continebatur. So all MSS. and edd. except A, Β, which have Δ,
‘continebat‚’ whence Baiter conjectures that the true reading may be· ⁷-ss

‘in illa cupiditate se continebat.'

10. Non pudor, non pudicitia. The words ‘non pudicitia' are ’ ,ἱ

omitted in A, B, are bracketed by Baiter, but retained by Classen, and
rightly. From the resemblance of ‘pudor’ and ‘pudicitia‚’ a careless
transcriber might readily allow one of them to drop out, or a half-
learned copyist might designedly omit ‘pudicitia,’ regarding it as
synonymous with ⁸ pudor? This, however, strictly speaking, is not the
case. ‘Pudor’ and ‘Pudicitia’ are connected as cause and effect.
‘Pudor’ is, properly, the principle of modesty, which produces ‘ Pudi-
citia’ or purity of conduct-‘Pudor’ belongs to the mind, ‘ Pudicitia’
to the body. Sallust (Cat. 12) employs the terms together. Moreover,
*although we can satisfactorily account for the omission of ‘pudicitia'
in the process of transcription, it is not easy to see how it could have
been interpolated.
