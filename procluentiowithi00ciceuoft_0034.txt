22 INTRODUC'TIOM

tions upon which the present prosecution was founded had
never been made at all, but were pure fabrications—for—

(1) They were not attested by any respectable person, the
only witness, apparently, whose name was attached
to them, being the farmer who was> the paramour of
Sassia.

(2) Of the two slaves who, it was pretended, had made the
depositions, one, viz. Nicostratus, was not forth-
coming, and the other, Strato, could tell no tales,
for as soon as the torture was over, his tongue had
been cut out by order of Sassia, and he had been
crucified.

(3) The form under which the pretended depositions ap-
peared stamped them a's forgeries. For the only
pretence for instituting the inquiry had been the
murder and robbery committed by Strato, and
granting it to be possible, although this was not
alleged by Attius, that in the course of the investie
gation some revelations might have been made
casually touching the death of Oppianicus, still the
principal subject must have been the facts con-
nected with the robbery and murder. But the
depositions produced did not contain one word
about the robbery and murder, but were occupied
exclusively with statements regarding the death of
Oppianicus. ’

Cicero sums up this portion of the defence by a magnifi-

cent peroration‚ in which he combines and concentrates and
exhibits at one view the career of Sassia, with all its
lengthened series of atrocious and complicated crimes, from
her connection with her son-in-law down to her persecution
of her son. He then represents how, at last, after she had
despatched her tool, the younger Oppianicus, to Rome, to
lodge the impeachment‚ she lingered behind at Larinum,
busied in seeking out and suborning testimony; and how, as
soon as she had heard that the day for the trial was fizoed
