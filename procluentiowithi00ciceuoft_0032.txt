20 INTRODUOTION.

her own, she put to the torture in the presence of some
respectable men, friends of the deceased, trusting that her
unhappy victims would be terrified into making statements
criminating her son. But although the most excruciating
torments were unsparingly applied on two different occasions,
the sufferers in the midst of their agony steadfastly main·
tained that they kne⁶w nothing, until at length the witnesses,
disgusted by her savage cruelty, compelled her to desist,
declaring that the object in view was evidently not to dis-
cover the truth, but to wring forth an assertion of what was

him her heir. Very soon after, a robbery‚ accompanied by
the murder of two slaves, was committed in the house of
Sassia, and the crime was brought home to that Strato, the
physician, whom we have mentioned above. Sassia eagerly
seized this as a plea for again putting Strato to the torture,
and by dint of threats forced young Oppianicus to give up to
her Nicostratus, against whom there was no charge, for the
same purpose. On this occasion she obtained, or rather pre-
tended that she had obtained, depositions to the effect that
her husband had been poisoned at the instigation of Cluentius,
and that the poison had been administered in a piece of bread
by an associate of Oppianicus, a certain M. Asellius. On these
