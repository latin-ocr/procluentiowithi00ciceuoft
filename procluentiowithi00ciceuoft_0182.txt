24. Hos vestigiis Oppianicus consecutus est. A. Β, and some ⁴
other MSS. have ‘secutus est‚' and so Class„ but the common reading ,
is better, since it implies that Oppianicus not only ‘followed in their ’
track’ but ‘joined them,' which we learn from what follows was ς
actually the ease. ·

30. Atque ibi pernoctaret, ibi diem, &c. So, B, and Class. Α

Most MSS. have ‘atque ibi pernoctaret. et ibi diem: but the ‘et' is '- ¹

decidedly offensive, and may have grown out of the last syllable of the
preceding word ‘pernoctaret' A few MSS. have ‘et ibidem posterum

commoraretur.’ Lambinus, combining these two readings, introduced γη
the conjectural emendation, ‘atque ibi pernoctaret, et ibidem diem :,

posterum commoraretur( which was adopted by Ernesti, Weiske,

Schiitz, and Orelli.

C has‘ atque ubi pernoctaret ibi diem p. c.. ’ which, by Orelli, is ἶ
termed‘ pessima lectio‚’ but has been adopted by Baiter, and' is probably ἶ

πῖ). 74.1. 4. Brevi illo tempore, i. e. ‘within a short period after ’γ
these transacfions! '

5. Areum-ias quasdam. Cicero, in all probability, here indioetes
some of those exoevations made for the purpose of obtaining the ζ,
volcanic sand now called ⁶ pozzuolana.’ This has been extensively used Ϊ
for building purposes from a very remote epoch, and thus the almost ,

endless maze of the famous Catacombs has been formed.
14. Qui tum erat triumvir. That is one of the ‘Triumviri ‘Capi-
tales' who exercised summary jurisdiction over slaves, foreigners, and

malefactors of the lowest class, when guilty of trifling offences, and, like f

our police magistrates⁹ made the preliminary investigations in cases of

murder or serious breaches of the peace. Their tribunal was placed in f

the Forum, beside the 'Columna Maenia: which Is the ‘columna'
alluded to below; and the circumstance that Manlius had, in early life,

been himself often dragged hither as a malefactor, proves how disre- ζ-

putable his position and pursuits must have been at the outset of his
career. With regard to the origin and name of the ‘ Columna Maenia:

see Pseud. Ascon. in Divin. 16, ξ 50, and Plin. H. N. 34. 5; 7. 60; but ²

these statements cannot be reconciled except upon the supposition that

there were two pillars bearing this appellation. See also Schol. Bob. ’

in Orat. Pro Sextio, 5¹.

15. Nullo teste. There is no inconsistency here with what is said ⁹

below, ξ 39. ‘ testibus multis . . . probabatur! No one had appeared to ³¹

accuse Avillius, when goaded by the stings of conscience he made a full 2

confession; but aster he had disclosed the facts of the case, his testi-

mony could be confirmed by many witnesses‚ and especially, we may ,
