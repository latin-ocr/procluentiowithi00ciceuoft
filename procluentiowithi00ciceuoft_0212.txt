intricate sentence, and various emendations have been proposed ι
different editors. Classen, while pointing out the deficiencies of ·[{
predecessors‚ has himself sailed to give a full and clear explanation·
The argument, plainly stated, is to this effect— ,-
The opponents of Cluentius maintain that his guilt may be inferr-
from the condemnation of Staienus
Itis true that Staienus, when impeached for a different offence, ν· ‘ss
attacked on account of his behaviour at the trial of Oppianicus. tu.
the Cominii, who conducted the impeachment, direetly charged hiup
with having received money from Oppianicus for the purpose of brihtan
the jurors. Staienus did not deny that he had received money fro'
Oppianicus, but alleged that it was for the purpose of bringing abonii
a good understanding between Oppianicus and Cluentius—an explana·
tion which was received with derision‚ and Staienus, after the enormities ς
of his whole career had been exposed, was found guilty. g
Wherefore (quamobrem), continues Cicero, it being admitted byalf q .
parties (quum ita constitutum sit) that either Oppianicus or Cluentius
was guilty of bribery, ,
If it was formally decided, in a court of justice, by the conviction of
Staienus, that Oppianicus sought to bribe a jury, and had given money-⁵·
to a juror for the purpose of purchasing votes, ’
And if no trace of money given by Cluentius to a juror can be
discovered on the closest scrutiny,
And, finally, if the money of Oppianicus, after the trial was over, was ζ
found in the hand of a juror and taken away from that juror, who was Δ
Staienus, x
If all this is true (and the facts are notorious), who can doubt that =
the conviction of Staienus, far from telling against CluentiuS, affords in ,
reality a strong presumption in his favour? s
No doubt there is considerable indistinctness and confusion in words'
which follow ‘ Quamobrem' to the end of the chapter, and tlte clause J
‘ quum ita constitutum sit. ‚Oppianicus ' must be regarded as paren- ’
thetical3 but the punctuation of Orelli, who places everything from ¹
‘quum ita’ down to ‘ablata est’ within brackets, renders the whole ἶ
persectly unintelligible. 'ff
It is far from impossible that this want of distinctness may have ³²
been intentional on the part of Cicero. for his argument, when fairly χ
stated, will not bear examination—repeating, as he does, the fallacy ;
that bribery must have been confined to one of the parties. See above, J
23, ξ 64, and Introd. 5 11.
Remark that ‘ ita ⁹ does not refer to the preceding clause, but to what ἶ
follows ‘uti in illa culpa.’ Most MSS. have ‘reperitur.' which is in .-
