§ 20. ‘quam constanter et diligenter '-‘ quam constanter
et quam diligenter.’

§ 11. ‘quod quaeso, ne moleste ’—‘ quod quaeso, iudices,
ne moleste.’

„ ‘pater huiusce, homo ’—‘ pater huiusce, iudices,
homo?

Under the same head we may rank the omission or inser-
tion of words in certain situations in which it is difficult or
impossible to determine, a priori, whether they have been
omitted by carelessness or inserted as glosseS. Thus in 1,

‘Qamobrem alteram partem causae sic agemus, ut vos
doceamus: alteram [partem] sic, ut oremus'—

where the omission or insertion of the second ‘partem'
makes not the slightest difference in the meaning or con-
struction, but we omit it because, although found in one or
two of the very earliest editions, it appears in no good MS„
and is exactly the sort of word which would be inserted as a
gloss.

Again in 3, ς 7—‘ quod in hoc uno'—we retain the word
‘uno’ because, although not absolutely necessary, and omitted
in the Editio Princeps and some others, it is found in all MSS.

So there are words which in certain positions may be
regarded as expletives, and as such were liable to be inserted
or omitted. Thus in 6, § 8, we have followed A, B, C, and
one other MS. in reading—⁴ sin erunt et aperta,’ although all
other MSS. have ‘sin autem erunt,' ὅτε.

CLASS V1.-—Words which, although dffring t‘n form, have the
same meaning, and may, in vety many cases, be interchanged
without affecting the force or construction os the sentence.

To this class belong the conjunctions ‘et,' ‘que,’ ‘ac,’
‘atque 3’ ‘tum’‘and‘tunc;’ ‘ut‚’ ‘uti3’ ‘sicut,' ‘sicuti,·’ ‘ni,’
⁶ nisi3’ some of which we have already placed in Class 11.
