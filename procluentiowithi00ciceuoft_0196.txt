object when the natural succession of its parts is reversed, when th· .-
parts which ought to come first come last; ‘Perversus’ to an ob¹w⁴f
when placed athwart or at right angles to its natural position. Thus,
isa dog were to walk into a room tail foremost, this would be described
by the epithet ‘praeposterus; ' if he were to come in side-ways, by·
‘’perversus. The reason why Cicero calls Staienus‘ praeposterus atq· ²¹·
perversus‚' in the present instance, will be explained below. ’
2 5. Ne Gratis. The meaning is clear. Bulbus, as soon as he heard?
the welcome words ‘Nor FOR NOTRING,’ exclaims, ‘I will follow you ’
whithersoever you please.’ Orelli and many other edd. make nonseuse‘s
of the passage by placing ‘Ne Gratis’ within inverted commas, and' i
including it in the Speech of Bulbus. , ÷
29. Guttam adspergit huie Bulbo, &c This is one of those ‘⁷ ³
complicated puns upon proper names in which Cicero so much delights. ᾗ '
⁴ Gutta’ signifies a vessel with a long narrow neck which allowed the ¹
fluid contained in it to escape drop by drop only (guttatim), and hence J
the word is used to denote a cruet for oil, vinegar‚ or sauce os any kind: ··‚
⁴ Bulbus’ signifies an onion, or any root of a similar form; ⁸ Conditor? Ξ,
according to the quantity, which might be slurred in the pronunciation‚ ’
will be a derivative of ‘ Condere‚’ or of ‘ condire: ‘to season.’ Henoel ’ς
the meaning of the passage will be—‘and he himself, also, who had
cooked up the whole plot, sprinkles a little sance over this ouion ‚
(conjoins Gutta with Bulbus)—therefore the onion (i. e. Bulbus) having ¹
been thus seasoned appeared by no means harsh (repulsive) in flavour <g
to those who had tasted and swallowed a little bit of hope from his ·
discourse’-i. e. to those other jurors to whom he had communicated
the plans and promises of Staienus. The reading of this passage ns ζ’
given by Orelli and most edd. is quite unintelligible—⁸ Itaque minime ς
amarus is visus est qui aliquid ex eius sermone speculae degustarat!
A, B, have ‘ degustarant! and although all other MSS. are said to have ·’
‘degustarat,’ every one knows that this is the most common of
corruptions, the letters m and n in MSS. and also in early printed books
being frequently represented by a small line placed above the vowel.
and this line was very frequently omitted in transcription. Moreover, 1¹*
the word ‘ is’ in MSS. is commonly written as a contractiori of ‘iis' :J
and ‘ eis,’ and hence the confusion in this case. ,2
Observe also that vegetable Bulbi were not introduced at the '³
beginning of a repast. and therefore Cicero, in the previous sentence,
calls Staienus ‘ praeposterus atque perversus,’ because he began his, ’ἶ
mess with a Bulbus (initium facit a Bulbo), thus placing that first which ᾖ
should not have been first.
