T„ 8. Eoo ipso in 1000, i. e. the part of the court appropriated to the
m, their counsel and supporters, the ‘Subsellia reorum? See
{belom note on 24, ξ 65.
ν Δ 13. Quum in consitium iri oporteret. This rs a technical phrase.
When the jury on a criminal tn‘al, aster hearing the pleaders and
< fitnesses, proceeded to deliberate before giving their votes, they were
'uid ‘Ire in consilium‚' and the contending parties, when they had
κ μενεαΠγ brought their proceedings to a close, and had nothing further
to urge, were said, with reference to the jury, ‘Mittere in consilium.’
So a few lines lower down, ‘Itum est in consilium3’ and in 27, ξ 74
‘In consilium erant ituri iudices mm ,ut ne sine Staieno ιιι consilium
gia-etur.. ‚Consurgitur in consilium;' and in 30, 5 83⁶ Quum in con-
-i filium iretur. ..Quum m consilium mittebant.. .Ne ιιι consilium iretur!
t Whether the Jury actually retired from the public court for the purpose
γ ὀἱ considering their verdict, does not appear clearly from these passages,
rj ιιῑιὶιοιιεὶι we may perhaps draw this inference from the clause quoted
’ 'show—⁶ Consurgitur in consilium!
’ 14. Ex lege illa cornelia, quae tum erat. Compare this with
:- what is said 27, 5 75 ‘Consurgitur in consilium, quum sententias
'j'i'ssssoppianicua quae tum erat potestas, palam ferri velle dixisset}
¹ Voting by ballot in criminal trials was introduced by the Lex Cassia
’ in 137 1³.c.‚ but it is evident from the above passages that a Lex
Cornelia. passed, we must suppose, by Sulla, gave the aecused person
the option whether the jury should vote seeretly or openly. It is also
clear that the law in question had been repealed before the impeach-
ment of Cluentius, but it is not, as far as I know, mentioned elsewhere.
19. Prima¹ actione condemnatus est, i. e. ‘on the first hearing of
the cause! In cases of doubt and difficulty, when a majority of the
*iurors gave a verdiet of ‘Non liquet,' then the presiding judge said
'Amplius.’ and fixed a day for a second hearing (secunda actio). In
the present case the whole jury, with one exception, pronouneed
Scamander guilty on the first hearing (prima actione), proving that they
felt no hesitation—that his guilt was clear. It must be borne in mind.
that in trials ‘De Repetundis,' after the passing of the Lex Servilia
(104 u. e.), a second hearing (secunda actio) formed an essential part of
the prooeedings, unless the ‘reuS,' as in the case of Verres, gave up
his muse in despair at the end of the ‘ Prima Actio-⁹ See again 37,
ς 103.
25. Bm sponte, i. e. not instigated by others.
28. Pronmtiatione. The ‘ Pronuntiatio‘ was the formal announce-
ment by the presiding judge of the verdict.
