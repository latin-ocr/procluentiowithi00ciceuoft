his first trial he was charged with having obtained admission into ι
jury, on the trial of Oppianicus, in an irregular and illegal„ manner, ’
offence for which the law imposed the penalty of a fine. On his v · .
trial he was charged directly with having received a sum of money ι ω’

after having stated that Falcula was acquitted without hesitation uponh -.'j
first tn'al, now affects great fairness. ‘ Non numero hanc absolution-
1 lay no stress on this acquittal—I do not reckon it as a point in η ῑ
favour, for even although he may not have been guilty of the off · ι
with which he was first charged, and which would have subjected =' υ
if guilty, to a pecuniary fine (ut illam multam non commiserit), it f
still very possible that he may have received a bribe in his capacity ἰ
juror (potest accepisse [pecuniam] captam ob rem iudicandam). ,
orator having now dismissed the first trial of Falcula, passes on mental
to the second, in which he was actually impeached sor money ⁸ cap ⁴ mg ε
ob rem iudicandam,’ and the train of thought seems to be as follows: ζ. ’
1 am willing to admit that the first trial of Falcula had no bearing u· ra‘
my case, and as to the second, Staienus, upon whose conviction so mue ζ’
stress has been laid, was nowhere impeached under the same law ιι
Falcula [on his second trial] (nusquam Staienus eadem lege dixit),
for it did not belong to the court which tried Staienus to take cogni? ·
zance os that particular offence of which Falcula was accused (Propnms
crimen illud eius quaestionis non fuit); Staienus having been impeached·
of‘ Maiestas‚’ Falcula ‘De Repetundis) Hence, neither on the ι- j
trial of Falcula, nor on the trial of Staienus, could the question wi “ ,Ἰ
regard to the corruption of the' Jury on the trial of Oppianicus be openedg
up; but on the second trial of Falcula the case was entirely different ·
here one of the jurors of Oppianicus, who had been singled out ’
guilty of having received a bribe, was impeached on that specific charge,
was honourably acquitted, and his innocence placed beyond a doubt. ‚
There is unquestionably a sudden and harsh transition in ιτ -s' uf ,
from‘ captam' to‘ nusquam, 'but this is not sufficient to justify us ms
pronouncing the passage wholly unintelligible. v

We have seen above (25, ξ 69, 27, ξ 73, 32, ξ 87) that 40,000 sesterwff«
was the sum which Oppianicus was believed to have promised to each
of sixteen jurors, and hence an assertion that Cluentius had given ⁴¹⁷¹,
