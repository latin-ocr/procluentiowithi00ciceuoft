f ¹7. Incommodissimis. So A, Β, and many other MSS. A few
have ⁸ incommodisss and so Orelli.
· πο. Huius villicos. A, B, and most MSS. have ‘villicum‚' but two
f lines belom all agree in ‘ villici!
’ 30. ns xxx, &c. It would appear that the legacy which the
⁷ testator intended to bequeath to Florius was 300,000 sestertii, but that
by some clerical error the sum named in the will was only 30,000‚
’ , aud that Cluentius, at first, refused to admit that the legatee had a
good claim to the larger sum.
[ P. 129.1. 1. Caelii cuiusdam, &c. This charge against Cluentius
2zarnounted to what, by lawyers. was termed ‘Plagium,' which is thus
defined by Ulpian (Digest. 48. 15, 1)
⁷ ⁶ Si liberum hominem emptor sciens emerit, Capitale Crimen adversus
lenm ex lege Fabia de Plagio nascitur: quo venditor quoque fit ob-
, noxius, si sciens liberum esse vendiderit.’
³ The word ‘Plagium' does not occur except in the legal writers of
’ἶ the Empire, unless we are to conclude from the passage above quoted.
ἶ that ⁶ Lex Fabia de Plagio ’ was the original title of the law in question.
we know not when or by whom this ‘Lex Fabia’ was passed, but it
was in force in the time of Cicero, and we gather from his words (Pro
, C. Rabirio 3, 5 8) compared with Ulpian (Coll. 14. 3), that it contained
ja chapter against those who bought, sold, or retained in their possession
’ a slave belonging to another person.
⁷ A, Β, and some other MSS. read the name ⁴ Ceius,' and so Class. and
Bait.
Ἴ 2. Mulierem quum emisset de sectoribus. A, Β, Class„ and
Bait. have ‘ a sectoribus? The word ‘ sector' originally signified simply
ι ‘ cutter, one who cuts,·’ and thus in Plautus we find ‘ sector zonarius ⁹
denoting a ⁸ cut-purse.’ But after the civil wars of Marius and Sulla,
a. class of pe1sons arose who made it their business to purchase con-
fimted property in the lump; and to realize a profit by dividing it,
ἶ, «ιῑῑίῃς it up as it were, into small portions, and disposing of it by
mail. These persons were styled ⁸ sectores,’ the sale itself being
2 finctio! '1⁹1oe occupation was regarded as invidious and disreputable,
md ‘sectores’ are generally spoken of with dislike and scorn. See
ᾖ Pseud. Ascon. on Cic. In Verr. Act. 2. ι, 52-61.
In progroes os time ‘sector' became the technical word used to
ἶ, denote ‘the purchasers of the property of an individual when that
ῖ property was sold on behals of the state: and ‘a sale os this description
-, was ‘sectio.‘ Thus, when the savourites of Nero were called upon to
“vrefund the sums which they had received, it became necessary to sen
⁴their property to satissy the demands of* the public-¹ ubique hasta, ⁴et
