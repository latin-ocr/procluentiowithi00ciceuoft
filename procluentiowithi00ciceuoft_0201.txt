16. Aooommodatus. See 18, ξ 36.
ao. Hominem aedilicium, iam praetorem, &c., i. e. a person who
{ffb-d held the office of Aedile, and whom men were already regarding as
η ff·- Praetor: i. e. regarded as certain of obtaining that office.
21. Clamore, de foro. So A, B,C1ass.and Baiter. All other
stass-MSS and edd. have ‘clamore hominum’ The word‘ hominum' is,
however, clearly unneeessary, and since it occurs in the preceding
‘ ‘opinionibus hominum’—the repetition would have an un-
=, mg effect.
Ὗ. De foro atque adeo de civitate, i e. Junius was compelled by
“-ssjffie popular outcry to retire from public life. The words cannot mean,
,χέει some commentators assert, that he was actually deprived of the
’ξ’ῦὶνίία5,’ for this penalty could not have been inflicted unless he had
³³1? been regularly impeached and condemned of a ‘ crimen capitale.'
fs« ²8. Quorum iudicium atque potestas est. Strictly speaking,
5³5⁸ iudicium’ will apply to the jury, ⁸ potestas ’ to the judge.

³ 30. At tum si dicerem, non audirer. In this and similar cases,

gssgrammarians generally say that the imperfect tense is used instead of
‚f ,ζῶε plupersect. It is quite true that the pluperfect might be employed here
= gvith perfect propriety‚ but the imperfect communicates great liveliness,
’ξ’ f' and ought to be rendered closely—⁶ If 1 were speaking at the period to

,χ which 1 refer, as Ι am now speaking, instead of having a most eagerly
z? ¹ attentive audience‚ as Ι now have, nobody would be listening to me!
P. 93. 1. 26. Profectio ipsius pecuniae, i. e. ‘the starting of the
money upon its journey of bribery.' ‘ Profectio' properly signifies ‘the
ξε act of setting out upon a joumey‚' and is used precisely in this sense by
Y‘, Cicero, Philipp. 1. 1, ξ 1

Jj'j ‘Exponam vobis breviter consilium et profectionis et reversionis
meae! -
⁹* 31. Quae ad eam rem. So A, B, Class.‚ and Baiter. All other
γ MSS. and edd. have ⁸ quae nunc ad eam rem,’ but ⁸ nunc· seems quite
’,έᾶ’ out of place here. ’
<- 1³. 94. 1. 2. vestigiis . . . odoranda est . . . cubile. The same
metaphoris followed out in greater detail in the speech In Pison. 34,
⁸ An vero tu parum putas investigatas esse a nobis labes imperii tui,
Ῐ stragesque provinciae? quas quidem nos non vestigiis odorantes in-
·” gressus tuos, sed totis volutationibus corporis et cubilibus persecuti
sumus!

3. vobis iudicibus. So A, Β, and Class. ς all other MSS. and edd.,
including Baiter, have ‘vobis ducibus: a reading which, at first sight,
appears appropriate, since it keeps up the metaphor, But, upon
