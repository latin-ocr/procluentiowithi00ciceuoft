15. Ab reo, i. e. ⁴ on behalf of the accused.'
16, Apud Ο. Orchinium. Here and in 53, ξ 147, as might
expected in the case of an uncommon name, we find a great ,variety
forms in the MSS.—-‘ Orchinium: ⁸ Orchivium‚’ ‘ Orchium,' ‘Archium
⁶ Cerinthium,' &c. The Turin Palimpsest‚ which is most likely to
right, has here ‘c0Rcmvm,' i. e. ⁶C. Orchium;’ and in 53, ξ 1 ¹
‘concrum' in the genitive. The person in question was one of «
Praetors of the year, and presided in the criminal court for trying ca· ⁴„ .
⁴ De Peculatu.’ ,
16. Locus ab iudicibus Fausto Sullae . . . non est. constitu ’ ,
i. e. ‘the Judices refused to place the cause upon the roll for “ .
We learn from this passage that the Judices attached to a crimi ’-Λ
court performed, to a certain extent at least, the functions of an ΕῃεῙ ’
Grand Jury‚ and could resuse to entertain a charge. We leam ’
from the Divinatio in Q. Caecilium, that when more than one aec 25]
came forward to prefer the same charge, the Judices‚ after he· '= f
parties, selected the individual whom they judged best qualified
conduct the prosecution; and we infer, from two passages in w„
speech, already noticed, that they could arrange the causes set d0··⁴
for trial in what order they pleased (20, § 563 22, ξ 59).
17. Fausto Sullae de pecuniis residuis. L. Cornelius Sulla, ψη,
of the Dictator, was named ‘ Faustus,’ an epithet intended to corres· ο “7„
with the title ‘ F elix,’ bestowed on his father. He is generally s· · .
os by Cicero and others as ⁶ Faustus Sulla: or simply as ⁶ F austus.' .
elder Sulla, during the period of his dominion‚ had drawn large ·s··=¹.
from the state treasury. After his death, when the party opposed t„
his measures was gradually gaining the ascendaney, and when fii
Tribunes had recovered (70 Β. c.) the powers of which he had strip εἷ
them, attempts were made to bring Faustus Sulla to trial, on
charge that a large amount of public money, which had not bei
applied to the public service, remained in his hands as his father's heir
Such sums were technically termed ‘Pecuniae Residuae‚’ and we uni·
several allusions in the Digest. to a ‘Lex Iulia de Residuis: a la 7,
which included also other kinds of embezzlement. Thus Marcian·
(Digest-13· 13 4 §3)—- ’
‘Lege Iulia de Residuis tenetur is apud quem ex locatione, emptionis
alimentaria ratione, ex pecunia quam accepit, aliave qua causa, pecun ;;
publiea resedit: .
An action of this nature had been brought against Faustus, in th
year in which this speech was delivered, by one of the Tribunes. bu*
had failed: and we learn fiom a fragment of the Oration for Cornelius‚·=
that Cicero himself had spoken against the measure in a public meeting
