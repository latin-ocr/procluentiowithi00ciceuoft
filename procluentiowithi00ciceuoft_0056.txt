We have examined, in the notes, the whole of these, and
indeed all the more important changes introduced by Classen
on the authority of A, B; and the conclusion at which we
have arrived is, that out of the sixteen various readings
presented as the most favourable specimens of the MSS. in
question, five only are decided improvements on the Vulgate,
viz. those numbered above (3), (7), (8), (10), and (13)—
but of these (8) and (10) can scarcely be regarded as due to
A, 133 for the mistake in (8) probably arose from the earlier

ι edd. not perceiving that ‘is,’ which is found in all MSS„ is

a contraction for ‘iis,’ and consequently introducing ‘degus-
tarat ' instead of ‘ degustarat ’; while C and many other MSS.
have in (10) the letters P, R, a common abbreviation for
‘Populus Romanus‚’ which were misinterpreted by the tran-
scribers of some inferior MSS. and by some of the earlier
edd. Again (7), the superiority of which is not very striking,
is found as a correction in the Cod. S. Marc. (the b of
Classen), in the margin of the Cod. S. vict„ and in Ammi-
anus Marcellinus: the mistake in the common reading in (3),
arose from the very common and obvious corruption of
‘hominum ¹ into ‘ omnium,’ and then into ‘ animum,' ‘ animi,’
‘amici‚' and the correction is found among the various
readings of C. Stephens3 while (13) consists merely in the
substitution of one preposition for another.

Of the remaining eleven, six, viz. (4), (5), (6), (11), (15),
(16), may be regarded as equal to the Vulgate, and are quite
