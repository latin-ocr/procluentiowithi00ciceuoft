17. Quaero, quis nocens? Every MS. except one has ‘qua ’
and yet edd. have, for the most part, without any good reason, 1· ὀ,
stituted ‘quaeso.’ A, B, have ‘ qui sit nocens,' Classen prints ‘quis : ν’
but the common reading is unexceptionable.

21. Aut hoc iudicium reprehendas, i. e. the decision of the court
in virtue of which Falcula was acquitted. Cicero here places '⁴
antagonist in a dilemma. ‘You‚' he says, ‘whose charge against ιτ t
client seemed to lean sor support on the decisions pronounced by cou ss:
of justice (rebus iudicatis), must now admit one of two things—ei ’uf
that the decision of the court in the case of Falcula was wrong, ἰ’ἱῖ- ’
which case the argument which rests upon legal decisions falls to te ¹
ground, or, that the decision in the case of Falcula was right, which ἰ- Ῐ
equivalent to an admission that bribery was not employed to pr· '³
the conviction os Oppianicus.’ ‘Tu’ is used with a strong emphasim?
A, B, have ⁸ nitebatur’ instead of ‘niti videbatur,' and so Class. aad,

29. Debuerint potius accusari, &e A person accused of ‘Amo‘-
bitus’ was charged with having given money for an unlawful purpose-*12
one accused ‘De Repetundis’ of having received money unlawfullysas
Therefore‚ if the jurors had been charged with corruption on the trial:
of Oppianicus, they must have been impeached ‘De Repetundis· αικὶ’ρ
not ⁶ De Ambitu.' ἶ

P. 107. l. 6. P. septimio scaevolae litem eo nomine ems*
aestimatam. The remainder of this chapter is perhaps the moab
embarrassing portion of the whole speech, the difficulty arising in part ›,
from some defect in the text, and in part from our want of precise ’
information regarding the legal process termed ‘Litis Aestimatio,' of
which Cicero, very naturally, affords no explanation, because. as he says, 5,
he was addressing persons perfectly familiar with the subject. Thero
is a note of Asconius on In Verr. Act. 1. 13, which throws considerable ³
light upon the term, which he thus defines- .

⁶ Hoc est, pecunia, de qua lis suit, et propter quam condemnatus est. ἒξ
in summam redacta, quae de eius rebus exigeretur. Duae res enim
consequebantur damnationem: pertinebat, qua vel simplex, vel duplex, ’
vel quadruplatio ducebatur: altera exilii.’ γ

sse latter portion of the note is corrupt, but the meaning is plain ³3:2¹
enough. Taking this in connection with the few passages scattered
through the works of Cicero and other writers, we may arrive at the Ἢ
following conclusions :— ⁸

i. The ‘Litis Aestimati0,’ in criminal trials1, belonged, strictis}

¹ The term was used also in civil suits.
