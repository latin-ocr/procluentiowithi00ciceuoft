over. A't the trial, after the speeches and evidence on both
sides had been heard, the votes of the jurors were given, not
by ballot, but openly, at the desire of the accused, who availed
himself of the option granted by a law at the time in force¹.
Those to whom it fell by lot to vote first were men of notori-
ously bad character, and all of these gave a verdict of guilty,-
some of the more respectable and conscientious, feeling con-
vinced that there was foul play somewhere, declined voting
(non liquere dixerunt); five gave a verdict of not guilty, but
when the votes were summed up, the accused was condemned
by a majority of twoss. In addition to the suspicions pre-
viously entertained, it soon transpired that a large sum of
money had been placed in the hands of C. Aelius Staienus,
one of the jurors, a senator of evil repnte, and well known
to be desperately embarrassed in his circumstances. It was
ascertained that Staienus had received this money for the
purpose of distributing it among the jurors, and had been
obliged to refund it in consequence of detection³. According

² The facts with regard to this decision are generally misrepresented
by commentators. Thus in the ‘ Argumentum’ prefixed to the edition of
Lemaire. it is stated that five gave the verdiet guilty, and five said ‘non
liquet‚’ in which case Oppianicus must have been acquitted 3 and in the
‘Inhalt' of Klotz, which is very long and elaborate, we are told that,
out of thirty-two jurors, all, with the exception of five, pronounced Op-

pianicus guilty. But from the Oration for Caecina (10) we learn that

the result turned upon a single vote. In stigmatizing the conduct of

ἰ Ἴ f Falcula, the orator says :-—

‘ In eum quid dicam, nisi id quod negare non possit? venisse in con-
silium publicae quaestionis quum eius consilii iudex non esset: et in eo

² consilio, quum causam non audisset, et potestas esset ampliandi, dixisse
,ι

cibi liquere .· quum incognita re iudicare voluisset, maluisse condemnare

Ἂν
³⁴²1 quam absolvere: quum ei uno minus damnarent, condemnari
' . mn non posset, non ad cognoscendam causam sed ad explendam

damnationem praesto fuisse!
’ Seventeen brought in a verdict of guilty, and that being a majority,

η’ Oppianicus was condemned; but if Falcula had said ‘non liquet‚' then

sixteen only would have said guilty, and sixteen not being a majority,
Oppianicus would not have been condemned. The exact state of the

s * vote is given below, p. 18. ⁸ 24, 28.
