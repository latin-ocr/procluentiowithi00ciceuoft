was not amenable to that chapter of the Cornelian Law on
poisoning which treated of conspiracy, but at the same time

under which, ostensibly, Cluentius was brought to trial, and in
developing the incredible profligacy and unnatural guilt of
Sassia, the mother of Cluentius, by whose machinations this
plot against her son had been contrived.

his Municipium. By one of his wives, named Magia, he had a

β. OPPIANICUs the younger, the accuser of Cluentius in the
present trial. He married the daughter, by a former mar-

Whenever the name· Oppianicus occurs in the following
narrative, the elder Oppianicus (a) is meant, unless the con-

trary is specially indicated. The elder Oppianicus was now
dead.
