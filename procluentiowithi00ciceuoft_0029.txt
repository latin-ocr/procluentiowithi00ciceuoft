iudiciis iam damnatus esset.’ In addition to the crime with
which he was specially charged, all the enormities of his
former lise were detailed at length with great force by
Canutius, who proved his statements by calling many wit-

Oppianicus, who had discerned the danger while still far off,
had applied to Staienus when Scamander was tried and had
succeeded in gaining his vote (20, 21, 24). He now, in great
alarm, again had recourse to him in order that he might

that, therefore, he (Staienus) was resolved to vote for his
condemnation. On the day when the proceedings were
