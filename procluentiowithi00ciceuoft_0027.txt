was requested to plead their cause at Rome. Yielding to
their solicitations, he undertook the task‚ and vehement con-
tests ensued between him and Oppianicus ¹, who being
‘immani acerbaque natura,' was still further stimulated by
the hatred which his wife Sassia bore to her son, and by the
knowledge that Cluentius had as yet made no will. If he
died intestate, his whole property would, according to Roman
law, have been inherited by Sassia, and thus have fallen into
the hands of Oppianicus. Hence it was resolved that Cluentius
should be poisoned. Oppianicus had long been in habits of
intimacy with two worthless depraved natives of Aletrium,
Caius and Lucius Fabricius, of whom the latter was now
dead. With the survivor, Caius, Oppianicus consulted upon
the best means of accomplishing his purpose ². Cluentius was
at this time in bad health, and was under the care of a
physician named Cleophantus. Fabricius began to tamper
with Diogenes, the slave of Cleophantus, and to offer him a
reward if he would administer poison to his master’s patient,
Cluentius. The slave feigned compliance, but disclosed the
proposal to his master, who, in turn, communicated the plot

² Klotz, in his Introduction to the speech, does not give a correct
view of this matter. He speaks as if Cluentius, at the instigation of
the Decuriones of Larinum, had brought a formal impeachment against
Oppianicus sor his conduct, and that Oppianicus, in order to get rid of
the prosecution, had sought to compass the death of Cluentius. But the
case was simply this :-Oppianicus asserted that certain persons, reputed
to be slaves, were entitled to be regarded as free men and Roman
citizens; the authorities and citizens of Larinum, on the other hand,
maintained that they were really slaves, and that the claim was un-
sounded. The suit, involving a question of Ius Civitatis, was carried
to Rome, where Cluentius and Oppianicus came into frequent and angry
collision as supporters of rival interests.

² 1f we are to understand the expressions of Klotz with regard to
l Fabricius—‘ Oppianicus setze sich also mit einem bekannten Meuchler
L. Fabricius in Verbiudung '—to mean that Fabricius was a well-known
massin or bravm they are much too strong; for Cicero describes the
character of the brothers Fabricii. previous to the attempt of Caius οιι
Cluentius, in general terms only, as notoriously bad—⁶ vitiis atque im-
probitate omnibus now—but perhaps the word ‘Meuchler' does not
necessarily mean a murderer.
