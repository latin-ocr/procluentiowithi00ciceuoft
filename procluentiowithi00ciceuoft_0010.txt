vi PREFA oE To THE FIRST EDJTJON.

I was induced by these remarks to pay more particular
attention than I had previously given to the speech for
Cluentius, and soon became convinced that no one of the
Orations of Cicero was more deserving of careful study,
and that, although not included in the ordinary selections
formed for the use of young scholars, it was, perhaps,
beyond any other, calculated to awaken their interest and
to invite them onwards.

It certainly possesses claims both external and internal
of the highest order.

Like that for the Manilian Rogation, it was composed
and delivered when Cicero was in the very prime of life
and intellectual vigour——before his mind had been harassed,
his temper soured, his courage shaken‚ and his energies im-
paired, by the anxieties, disappointments, dangers, and mis-
fortunes which beset his declining years. He had, at the
time, the strongest motives for exertion. His success in
public life had been uninterrupted, but the great prize was
not yet won. He had mounted high on the path of political
distinction, but the topmost pinnacle yet rose steep before
him, and this he could not hope to reach, except by main*-
taining and increasing that reputation as an orator, to which
alone he owed the favour of his countrymen and his previous
triumphs.

On examining the oration itself‚ it will be found full of
freshness and vigour, remarkable alike for clearness and
precision of statement in a case singularly complicated, for
force and acuteness of argument, and for magnificent bursts
of eloquence. Besides all this, it possesses an attraction
peculiarly its own3 for while elsewhere we are presented
with pictures of life and manners in Rome and in Rome
only, we here obtain a glimpse of the social habits and
relations of those who dwelt in the provincial towns of
