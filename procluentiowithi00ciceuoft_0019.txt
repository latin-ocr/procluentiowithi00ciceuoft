In order to deal systematically with his opponent, Cicero
also divides his reply into two great heads.

1. He declares that he will first seek to remove the ‘ Invidia'
against his client, and for that purpose he endeavours to
show—-

1. That no one had ever been accused of more atrocious
crimes, or convicted on more conclusive evidence than
Oppianicus.

2. That the very jurors who condemned him had in
reality pronounced him guilty beforehand by their verdicts
in two previous trials immediately connected with his crime—
trials‚ the fairness of which had never been impugned3 that
consequently they could not, without exposing themselves to
the charge of the grossest inconsistency, have avoided pro-
nouncing his condemnation (22), and that the only marvel
was that Oppianicus had ventured to stand a trial at all.

3. That, although there had been undoubtedly an attempt
made to corrupt the jury, Oppianicus and not Cluentius was
the corruptor. This he proceeds to demonstrate both by
argument and evidence. He dares his opponent to deny that
money had been given by Oppianicus, he defles him to prove
that the same fact could be established with regard to
Cluentius, and endeavours, by a priori reasonings, to show
that such a supposition was in the highest degree improbable.

4. He discusses, in sucoession, the various demonstrations
of public feeling, maintaining—that in some cases they had
proceeded from the unreasonable and unjustifiable means
resorted to for inflaming the passions of the multitude-that

many of the instances adduced by Attius had been unfairly

stated, or unfairly interpreted, or invested with more import-
ance than they deserved—that Iunius especially had been
borne down by popular clamour without being permitted to

f* say even a word in his own defence—and, finally, that no one

had been impeached directly for his conduct as a juror on the
trial of Oppianicus, with the exception of a single individual
who had been acquitted twice over.
