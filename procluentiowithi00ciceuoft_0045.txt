3. The office was apparently not uncommonly held by
those who had previously been Aediles. This was the
position of C. Iunius (29), and of a certain C. Visellius
Varro, a cousin of Cicero, of whom we read in the Brutus
(76)—‘ is, quum post curulem aedilitatem iudex quaestionis
esset, est mortuus!

4· But, although the office was one of dignity, it was not
constitutionally regarded as a ⁴ magistratus.' Of this we have
abundant proof. No magistrate could be brought to trial
while in office, but C. Iunius was tried and condemned in the
same year in which he had acted as ‘ Iudex Qaestionis ’ (33).
In a quotation found in the Digest (48. 8) from the ‘Lex
Cornelia de Sicariis,’ the terms ‘Magistratus’ and ‘Iudex
Qaestionis’ are distinguished—‘QUI QUUM MAGISTRATUS
ESSET, PUBLICOVE IUDICIO PRAEESSET: QUIVE MAGISTRATUS,
IUDEXVE QUAESTIOMS, 013 CAPITALEM CAUSAM PECUNIAM
ACCEPERIT.’—To which we may add that, while a Praetor
was not obliged to swear that he would administer justice
according to the law under which an accused person was
tried, this form was incumbent on a ‘ Iudex Qaestionis‚’ and
one of the charges against C. Iunius was that he had omitted
to take the oath (33).

Our authorities do not enable us to state any additional
particulars. We do not know whether a fixed number of
these officials was elected every year, nor the mode of their
election, nor even whether they were elected at stated in-
tervals, or only when a necessity for their services arrived.
Nor, supposing a certain number to have been regularly
chosen, can we tell how they were distributed, whether
one (or more) was attached to each Praetor, to be em-
ployed at his discretim, or whether a particular department
was assigned to a ⁴ Iudex Qaestionis’ after the duties of the
Praetors had been settled. We have seen above that the
‘Lex Cornelia de Sicariis,’ &c., contemplated the appoint-
ment of a ‘Iudex Qaestionis‚' and it is remarkable that
wherever we hear of a ‘ludex Qaestionis’ in reference to
