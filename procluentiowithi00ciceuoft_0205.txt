‚At enim iudicia facta, &c. Here begins a new division of the
” , ‘At enim '—it will be urged, says Cicero, that many legal
ν’ ‘ons have been pronounced to the effect that Cluentius employed
J· » ry on the trial of Oppianicus. To this Ι reply—
212. That no direct decision has been or could have been pronounced‚
J =· · · the question of the guilt or innoeence of Cluentius was never
” m· ’tted to a court of justice directly (suo nomine) until now.
, ὓ. 'rhose decisions which, it is pretended, asseited indirectly the guilt
, Cluentius, cannot be regarded as possessing any weight, for some
⁵ ’ἶ them were of a violent and tumultuous character, some of them had
ἶ proper bearing on the case, some of them actually told in favour
ξ >gi Cluentius, and some were of such a description that they have never,
my time, been either called or considered legal decisions.

g. 14. Ita. .diu iactata ista res est. The words‘ is ta res’ seem to
found in all MSS„ but are bracketed by Baiter at the suggestion of
