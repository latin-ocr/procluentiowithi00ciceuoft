  5} 33—36. NOTES. 169

not too subtle for a public speaker addressing a J'ury. Cicero is not
refining here. He wishes simply to impress upon the jury that Magius
lud formed a very bad opinion of Oppianicus, and that the event had
fully proved that he was not mistaken. If we omit ‘non,’ the force
os the passage will be-mark what Oppianicus did, in order that you
may undersand that Magius saw far into the future, when he deemed it
necessary on his death-bed to take preoeutions against his villany.

1². 73. 1. 2. Quae tum ex tabulis, &c. Here ‘tum ’ is emphatic—
⁰2t the time when the muse of Oppianicus was tried: So at the end of
1³ ‘Ac tum in Oppianici musa? and 14, §40 ‘id quod ipsius tabulis
tum est demonstratum.'

6. Decem inis mensibus. Ten lunar months, according to the
belief of the Romans, was the regular period of gestation‚ and Magius
had solemnly (obtestatione) requested his wife to remain in the house
of her mother-in-law until that period had expired. Thus ovid, when
speaking (F ast. 1. 33) of the division os the year by Romulus into ten
months-

⁸ Quod satis est utero matris dum prodeat infans,
Hoc anno statuit temporis esse satis.'
Ι 7. Quinto mense post. viri mortem. This was a violation os
common decency. For every widow was expected to mourn during ten
months for the decease os her husband. This circumstance also is alluded
to by Ovid in the lines which immediately follow those quoted above—-
⁸ Per totidem menses a sunere coniugis uxor
Sustinet in vidua tristia signa domo.’

11. Asinii Larinatis. Great variations in the MSS. as to the name
oi this person. ‘Asinius' is the form adopted by Orelli and most edd.
⁵ Asuvius ' is preferred by Class. and Baiter. So, in like manner, we are
free to choose between ‘Avillius;' ‘Avilius;’ ‘Aurilius;' ‘Arulius;'
·Avulius ;’ ‘Aiulius ς’ ‘Aulius;' and several other forms.

ι 5. Aooommodatua. So almost every MS. (there is a doubt
about C), but the great majority of edd. have, without any good reason,
substituted ⁴ accommodata: and so Baiter. The phrase occurs again, 29,
ς 79, ⁸ homo . . . ad inflammandos animos multitudinis accommodatus?

ιο. Ratio . . . res. ⁶ Ratio,' ⁸ the plot or plan ;’ ⁸ Res,¹ ¹ the execution
of the plan3' as explained in the next sentence‚-‘1nire consilium . . .
Perficere rem! q

οι. Inire enim id eonsilium. A, Β, and several other MSS. omit
qd: and so Class. and Baiter. It is objected that ‘ id' is out of place,
since the nature os the plot had not yet been described; but. on the
other hand, ‘Ratio,' in the preceding sentence, indicates that a definite
plot had been formed. A, B, E, have ⁸ iniri‚' and so Class.
