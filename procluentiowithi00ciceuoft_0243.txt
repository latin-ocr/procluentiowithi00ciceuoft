{¹ solicit travellers to 'enter (invitare); is'a traveller consented he was said
,, ·· ‘decedere de via: or ‘ devertere‚' and hence ‘deversorium’ is the common
word for ‘an inn.' The meaning will be something to the following

ἓξ· effect—It is not requisite that I should say anything with regard to this

man for the present. But is the sellow give me a pressing invitation,
η f which is part of his trade, 1 shall turn the tables on him, and entertain
him with such right good-will that he will be very sorry that he ever
turned aside from his path to come to close quarters with me.

αι. Cicero now enters upon that portion of the case which referred

to the charges of poisoning preferred against Cluentius—the only portion.
ξιῇῗ according to the representations of the orator, over which the court
⁷} had. in the present instance, any jurisdiction.

28. O. Vibium capacem. The name is uncertain. A, B, have

Δ ¹ ‘Cappadocem’ upon which Classen remarks—‘Hanc praestantissimorum

‚ MSS. scripturam eo minus. repudiare visum est, quod aperte peregrinus
Ἰ erat Vibius iste qui Romae apud hospitem habitabat!

, This appears to me to be one instance of many where Classen is
’,Α blinded by the determination to support his two favourite MSS. For,
’· i. The word ‘hospes’ was no longer restricted to its ancient and
* proper signification, as we may see from various passages in this very
, speech. Any stranger from an Italian town, although himself a Roman
citizen, would, if he were paying a visit to a friend at Rome, be said
j ⁸ habitare apud hospitem!

’ ἰί. 1f the person named was really ⁸ C. Vibius Cappadox,' we should
at once inser that he was the Asiatic freedman os some Roman C. Vibius

' 1 —but such a person was little likely to have been the ‘hospes’ and
5 ⁶ familiaris ’ os a senator.

iii. But we can almost demonstrate that he was no foreigner, for it
Ἀ appears from the conclusion of the chapter that he was the uncle

, (avunculus) of Numerius Cluentius, a Roman knight.

⁴ P. 130. l. 1. At heres est Cluentius. A, B, and several other MSS.
omit these words; those MSS. which exhibit them have either ‘aut

³ ἲ heres,' or ‘haud heres ς’ ⁴ at' is a conjectural emendation. Classen. who
is followed by Baiter, brackets the clause, and argues strongly that it
,⁸ is an interpolation: but it is difficult to see why Cicero should have
alluded at all to the disposition of this person's property, unless some
³²⁷ charge had been preferred against his client in connection with the
succession. It would appear that the whole charge had been trumped
,· “ up in consequence of the property of Capax having been inherited by
² a Cluentius whom the prosecutors‚ by mistake, supposed to be A. Cluen-
tius Habitus.
