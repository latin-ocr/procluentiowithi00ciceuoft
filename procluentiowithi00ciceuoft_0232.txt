2. Idcirco se nullam. This is the reading οἱ nearly all the MSS-,2
but the edd. before Classen exhibit-‘idcirco se nullam umquam o ³
tionem scripsisse, ut, si quid aliquando quod non opus esset, ab se eser<
dictum, posset se negare dixisse ¹—a reading which appears first in the]-
Iuntine edition, and seems to have been derived from conjecture. ,

5. Proinde quasi, si quid a nobis, διο. So A, B, Class.. ani Bau.
All other MSS. and edd. omit ⁴ si‚' which is perhaps unnecessary. ,
Lambinus has ‘ quod. ’ [ .

10. Qui quum Gn. Plancum defenderet„ .dioitu1·. ‘Qui’ is . ;
the nominative to ‘dicitur,’ the numerous intervening clauses beinff‘ i
subsidiary or parenthetical. 4

On. Plancum. There can be no doubt that this is the persons ,
mentioned by Quintilian (6. 3) and by Cicero, De Orat. 2. 54. In thaz
latter passage he is called ‘Cn. Plancus,’ here the MSS. give the praed
nomen ‘C.’ or ‘L.,’ and in Quintilian, ‘C.’ or ‘Cim' Nearly all the ⁵
MSS„ however, agree in ‘Plancus,¹ although the form ⁴ Plancius' 112ss
been adopted by most edd. ,j

11. Accusante Μ. Bruto. This is the Iunius Brutus of whom Cicero '
speaks so disrespectfully in the Brut. 34, ξ 130

‘Isdem temporibus (i.e. about 100 B.C.) M. Brutus, in quo magnum
suit, Brute, dedecus generi vestro: qui quum tanto nomine esset patrem·-
que optimum virum habuisset et iuris peritissimum, accusationem« „
factitaverit, ut Athenis Lycurgus: is magistratus non petivit, sed fuit ἶ
accusator vehemens et molestus, ut facile cerneres naturale quoddamssfi
stirpis bonum degeneravisse vitio depravatae voluntatis? ἰλ

Elsewhere (De Off. 2. 14), he tells us that this person was nicknamed· j
The accuser, from his eagerness in instituting prosecutions—⁴ sordidum
ad samam, committere, ut accusator nominere: quod contigit M. Brutos*
summo genere nato, illius filio, qui iuris civilis in primis peritus suit! ’ ”

The father, mentioned in the above passage and in many others 881³*
an eminent 1awyer, is noticed in this chapter as ⁶ M. Brutus pater illius '11
accusa-roms! These Bruti seemed to have belonged to the sames*
family as M. Iunius Brutus the τνραννοκτόνος, but it is difficult to traoe j
the relationship. =.

¹4· In dissuasione, &c. The place here spoken of is Narbo
Marcius (Narbonne), the chief city of Gallia Narbonensis, and is thus >J
characterized by Cicero, Pro Fonteio ι, ξ 3

‘Est in eadem provincia Narbo Marcius, colonia. nostrorum civium,⁶ ἶ·
specula populi Romani, ac propugnaculum istis ipsis nationibus opposi- ⁷
turn et obiectum.’

A Roman colony was first planted at Narbo 118 nc.. in the Consul-'
ship of M. Porcius Cato and Q. Marcius Rex (Velleius 1. 15), from the: ζ-
latter of whom the epithet ‘ Marcius ' was derived. ’
