7. Atque etiam. These words mark an aposiopesis—⁸ Was
investigation instituted with regard to the death of Oppianicus · --ὴ
years after the event? Yes, and not only did she do κινεῖς-,οὔπα she e ...⁷
went so far‚’ &c.

20. Habuisset . . . conata est. Classen and Baiter, following A, B,
and one other MS. read‘ habuisses. .conata es, 'thus converting the
sentence into a direct appeal to Sassia, and arranging the punctuation·
as follows: - “

‘Itane tandem, mulier, iam non morbo sed scelere furiosa? quum
quaestionem habuisses . . . conata es!

24. Non di'oam viro, ne colonum. &c- If Cicero had said that·
no man was present, his opponent might have contradicted him aad> ’
said that the ‘colonus’ (62, ξ 175) was present. Cicero, therefore, ·
believing that this person actually was present, corrects himself by,
anticipation, as it were, but guards against the supposition that he*
could be called a respectable (bono) man. The reading, ‘abfuissa’
adopted by some of the earlier editors, destroys the sense of the„
passage. ·

26. An hoo dicitis . . . mementote. So A, B. Orelli has ‘An
hoc dicitis: mihi enim venit in mentem, quid dici possit, tametsi adhuc
non esset dictum.’ omitting ‘mementote‚’ which, however, is found iu'>
every MS. All MSS. except A, B, have ‘adhuc’ idstead of ‘ab Βοο;”
the greater number have ‘posset' and ⁶ essetf Different editors Βανὲ
moulded the text into different forms to suit their fancy. The explana· =
tion given by Classen of the text we have adopted is satisfactory. .

‘Cicero quum id, quod solum ab accusatoribus excusandi gratia dici.
potuit, ipse proferat, iudices admonet, id ipsum tamen ab Attio non
esse dictum, tametsi ab hoc non esse dictum, mementote. Laetatur igitur, ¹
ab improbis solam excusandi rationem, qua innocentem opprimere‘ ’
potuissent, non esse inventam?

P.137.1. 1. Quorum eminet· audacia. atque proiecta est, i. e,-

‘is conspicuous and thrown forward into full relies? So m Verr. Act. ’-
2. 1,2 ,

‘Est idem Verres qui fuit semper; ut ad audendum proiectus, sic
paratus ad audiendum’ -i. e. ‘forwardss The word, in its literal sense,
occurs, De Orat. 3, ξ 128‘ Brachium procerius proiectum? .“ ,Ἰ

5. Nihil clarius Larini fuit. A, Β, omit‘ fuit? It is retained Β]
Classen, and bracketed by Baiter. ,ἔ

8. An id quod dicendum, &c. Classen exhibits this sentenceas ἕ
follows :—‘ An, id quod vobis dicendum est, et quod tum ‘Sassia ἀίεῐανὶίί ’
quum de furto quaereret, turn Stratonem iisdem in tormentis dixi -“
de veneno ?’ N early all MSS. have ‘dictitavit.’ B has ‘ quaereret.' Δ,- ’
