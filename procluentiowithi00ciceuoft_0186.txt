miles south-east from Aletrium, and the proximity of thesstwo towns is
alluded to in the next chapter (17, §49). ‘quod mihi cum Aletrinatibus :¹
vicinitatem . . . esse sciebat.’ ,

According to Priscian (7. 14, ξ 71) we ought to write ‘Aletrinati’ in .
the ablative'. A, Β, haxfe ⁴ Larinati,’ a manifest blunder.

²9· Cleophanto. Observe that the physician is a Greek. Medicine ,
was not at this time regarded as a liberal profession by the Romans,
and was sor a long period practised chiefly by foreigners.

31. Servus non incallidus, sed, . . . frugi, &c. So D, E, and

most MSS. and edd. A, B, and the Cod. S. Vict. have ‘et' instead of 2
‘sed‚' and so Class. and Baiter. But ‘sed' is required here. To have :-
said that a slave was ‘ callidus: or even ‘non incallidus: would have ³
been by itself reproach, not praise; the ‘sed' is introduced as a quali· ,
fication—-‘ the slave who was not without craft, mn· at the same time ἐξ

honest and upright.'

P. 78. l. 3. M. Baebio senatore. It is almost unnecessary to say

that the MSS. vary much in this name here, and below in 19, ς 53—

⁴ Baebio '—‘ Bebio'—‘ Baebrio'—-‘ Bebrio ’—-‘ Baevius’—-‘ Bevius'-—‘Bo- 2
vius‚’ &c. A, B, have ‘Bebio,' the great majority of MSS. ‘Baebrio,’

and most edd. write ⁶ Bebrio.’ :L
“ 4. Qua dignitate. Most MSS. and edd. have ‘ qua dignitate! Β has {Q

‘ quanta diligentia.¹ A, ‘ qua diligentia‚’ and so Class.,who observes-⁴ In

amici periculo defendendo diligentia opus est non dignitate? This is ,

perhaps saneisul. Cicero wishes to impress upon his audience that Bae· ·³
hius was a man os honour, of sagacity, and of high standing, and there·
sore one whose advice might be safely followed; and Baebius does not ’ῒῖζ
seem to have done more than give advice. Hence ‘dignitate' is more ,js

appropriate than ⁸ diligentia.’

6. Aut comprehenderetur ree, i. e. ‘in order that the truth os the j-
story might be firmly grasped’ (ascertained). ‘Comprehenderetur' is s
not quite synonymous with ‘deprehendereturx as some of the older π.

commentators assert.
8. Ne multis: Diogenes emitur: venenum, &c. Classen.

following A, B, presents the text of this passage under the following ἶ
form :—

‘Ne multa: Diogenes emitur: venenum diebus paucis comparatur: ³

multi viri boni quum ex occulto intervenissent, pecunia obsignata‚·quae Χξ

ob eam rem dabatur, in manibus Scamandri, liberti Fabriciorum, ζ),

deprehenditur’—and so Baiter.

Classen objects to the common reading, upon the ground that it is

absurd to suppose that the poison and the purchase-money would both ·

be seized at the same moment in the hands os the same person. But he „2⁵ss
