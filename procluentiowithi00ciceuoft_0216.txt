28. P. Octavio Balbo. In the speech against Verres, Act. 2. 2, 1 ,ἦ
we read of a L. Octavius Balbus, iudex, homo et iuris et officii peri 13
simus ’—-whom we might reasonably suppose to be the same pe · 4
with the individual here named, but all the MSS. have in this pass- 2.st
⁶ P. Octavio Balbo! ·’

10. Ingenio, &c Observe that all the qualities necessary to rend-
a man a perfect juror are here enumerated-‘ natural ability; legal kno .,
ledge; high sense of honour; conviction of the sanctity of an oathss
activity and conscientiousness in the discharge of duty? ³
14. Ambitiosus‚ i e. ‘a courter of popularity! , ,
27. Quod erat· odium? This· is equivalent to the expression in t· π, ξ
following chapter, ξ 110 ‘quanto in odio. .suit;’ ‘odium' may ι a ¹
used to denote ‘the hatred which we inspire in others,' as well as ··t .- ¹
hatred which we feel towards others.’ Thus, in Plaut. Asin. 2. 4, 60 Ἰ ’

‘Perii hercule! iam hic me abegerit suo odio,’

i. e. by ‘his hateful presence‚' which some os the commentators on thas
passage erroneously interpret by ‘ sua i1·acundia.'

28. Quanta. ignoratio sui? The MSS. here and elsewhere hesitate
between‘ ignoratio' and‘ ignorantia? Classen, following Α B, adop
the latter, with the remark, ‘Si quod utriusque formae discrimen ad?
mittendum sit, haud dubie in eo cemitur‚ quod ignoratio in sin ¹
rebus male intellectis versetur, ignorantia insitum animi vitium contineat ὲ.
quod ipsum nostro loco eonspicitur' But if this doctrine be correct-,J
the introduction of‘ sui,’ which indicates a specific kind of ἰξιιοι·ει.ικ>ιί.-4
demands that we should employ‘ ignoratio? For deficieuey ιιι a single, ,ξ-
although highly important, branch of knowledge, viz., selfikuowledgef,
does not necessarily imply a total want of knowledge, or any generat.
incapacity for the acquirement os knowledge. ·

29. Qui illud etiam ipsum. Classen and Baiter, following A, Β,
have ‘illud iam ipsum,' which affords a good meaning. ‘Etiam’ wiff-
indicate extent, ‘ iam ' progress. ’-

3²- Proinde quasi. See above, note on 21, ξ 57. Α

Ρ. 105. 1. 11. Post adventum 1.. Sullae a tribunicia. voe&
desertum. A, B, omit ‘a,’ and so Classen. The orator here ‘alludet‘>
to the ordinances of Sulla, by which he stripped the Plebeian Tribunes·
of all those powers which they had gradually usurped' ιιι the course of<
centuries, and reduced the office to its original simplicity. The Tri- ,ζ’
bunes were reinstated ιιι their former position by Pompeius, 70 Β. c.
