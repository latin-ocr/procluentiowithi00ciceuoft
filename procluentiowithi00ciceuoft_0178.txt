the above clauses would be destroyed if we were to insert ‘omnes'
before ‘ oderant‚’ and thus introduce the community at large. ’τ’

Any one who reads the note of Classen will see that he arrives at²
exactly the opposite conclusion.

28. A P. Canutio. Cicero, in the Brutus (56, ξ 205), speaks of ,
Canutius in very complimentary terms :—

‘Sulpici orationes quae feruntur, eas post mortem eius scripsisse
P. Canutius putatur, aequalis meus, homo, extra nostrum ordinem, meo
iudicio disertissimus.'

Priscian (8. 4, tom. 1, p. 569, ed. Krehl.) h‘as preserved a single
sentence of this orator to exemplify a meaning of ‘ admirari.’-—Canutius:
‘turpe est propter venustatem vestimentorum admirari, ut propter
turpissime vitam actam non contemnere ' :—-admirari θαυμάζεσθαι.

P. 71. 1. 1. Propiora hujus causae. A, B, E, and several other
MSS. have ‘propriora,’ which has, however, not been adopted by any
good editor. ⁴ Causae ’ is in the dative, and ⁴ huius’ refers to Cluentius..
‘ Huiusce: which is given by Classen as his own conjecture, but which.
according to Baiter, is found in A, Β, seems unnecessary.

10. Mori. So all MSS. and edd. except A, B, Class., and Bait„
which have ‘ emori.’ Classen says—⁸ non negligenda videtur optimorum
codd. scriptura, quae praecedentis verbi terminatione facile potuit
obliterari, pro vulg. mori. Emori autem Ciceroni est misere mori.' Sic
infra 14, ξ 45, Pro Rab. Post. io, ξ 20. But the ‘misere’ is fully exv
pressed in the text by the words ‘maximo curn dolore? and although
⁸ emori’ would have been appropriate enough in a simple narrative, it
seems out of place in a reported exclamation.

17. Fraterno parricidi03 and again, in 11, ξ 32. Multa. parricidia.
There can be little doubt that the word ‘Parricidium’ originally de—
noted, specially, ‘ the murder of a parent‚’ and it certainly was used in
this restricted sense in all periods of Roman history. Itis equally certain
that, from a very remote epoch, ‘ Parricidium' was employed to denote
the crime of ‘ wilful murder ’ without any reference to'the consanguinity
of the parties (See Paul. Diae. s. v. ‘Parricidii Quaestores'). This
extension of the term has been explained on the supposition that in the
ruder ages of Italian society, the punishment of ordinary murder was
left to private revenge, as among Arab tribes, and that the law
took no cognizance of homicide except when a parent was the victim,
in which case the crime was regarded as so terrible and portentous that.
if not expiated by the blood of the offender, it would have brought
down the wrath of heaven upon the whole community. The early
legislators, in order to put an end to violence and outrage, ordained
that wilful murder should be punished with death, just as if it were
