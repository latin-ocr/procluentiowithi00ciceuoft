·· ”’”,”ὶ1>ονε 8, ξ 28, and note; and again, 32, ξ 87. The ⁸ Confirmator' in a
Ῑ, brihery transaction was one who became security for the payment of the
(money promised.
ῖς, Ρ. 89. l. 2. Ut blandissime potest. A, B, have ‘placidissime,’ and
Ἶζμο Class. and Baiter. Classen remarks—⁸ Sic rectius, scribitur: nam
ζ ’ revera iratus placidum vultum simulabat Bulbus? But the common
, , reading is better, for the expression of countenance assumed by Bulbus
fjis indicated by ‘hilari vultu,' while ‘blandissime’ represents his sost
*325 insinuating manner in addressing Staienus.
’<”ζ’ Instead os ‘ hilari’ A, Β, have ‘hilarol Both forms are unexception-
si able, but the former is the more common, and therefore ‘hilaro’ is
gs: more likely to have been changed by a transcriber into ‘hilan',' than
'i vice versa. ’
Quid tu, inquit, Paete? &c. This is another complicated joke
upon a proper name which cannot be understood without entering
’ζ’ into some preliminary details. Cicero in the Brutus, while charac-
terizing his own contemporaries, thus speaks of Staienus (68, 5 241) 2——
· Et C. Staienus, qui se ipse adoptaverat et de Staieno Aelium
ᾖ· .ῖέ fecerat. fervido quodam et petulanti et furioso genere dicendi: quod quia
''2'‘ =.‘ multis gratum erat et probabatur, ascendisset ad honores, nisi in
L . 4 facinore manifesto deprehensus poenas legibus et iudicio dedisset.’
y ᾗ We leam from this passage, taken in connection with our text,
that the original and proper name of this individua] was Staienus, but
52 that, by some irregular or seigned adoption, he had intruded himself
’4ᾗῶ into the Gens Aelia, and assumed the designation of C. Aelius Paetus
. ' Staienus.
ζ ⁵ The Gens Aelia was divided into several ‘ familiae,’ of which, in the
time of Cicero, the most distinguished were those which bore, respec-
,g tively. the ¹ cognomina‘ os Lamia-Ligur—aud Paetus.
.: ’ These things being premised, Cicero here declares that when Staienus
”r adopted himself into the Gens Aelia he had selected (delegerat) the
ξζ cognomen of Paetus in preference to that of Ligur (having just as little
right to the one as to the other), because if he had called himself Ligur,
he was conscious that he was such a brute that people would never have
‚ supposed that this appellation had any relation to the noble race of the
Aelii. but would have regarded it as a· mere epithet denoting his
⁷ barbarian origin, and his descent from some wild horde of Ligurians.

In the above sentence all MSS. and edd„ except A, B, Class.‚ and
Baiter, have ⁶ nationis magis suae quam generis! Classen omits ⁶ suae‚’
arguing that Staienus was certainly not a Ligurian. 1 feel satisfied that
⁸ suae' is not an interpolation. and should resume its place in the text.
Staienus was not a Ligurian, but Cicero introduces ⁶ suae ’ as a stroke of
