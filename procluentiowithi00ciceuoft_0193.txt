{bnt that he felt no confidence of escape by any other course (alia
ἶ ναίοιτε) except bribery.

¹9. Iniquus Cluentio. Α, Β, and several MSS. have ‘inimicus‚'
and so Classen and Baiter. But there is no question here of personal
hostility towards Cluentius; Cicero wishes to rest his argument on the

ἑ broad basis of justice and fairness.

3. υ. Si doceo, non ab Habito, ὅτε. See Introd. 5 11.

’ 24. eorrumpendi iudicii.. So A, B, Class. and Bait. All other
ζῖ,Ἰί88 and edd. omit ‘iudiciiss which is not absolutely necessary, and
5 may be a gloss.
2³ P. 86. l. 7. Negata, negate, inquam. So all MSS. and edd.
²³ “cept A, Β, class, and Baiter, who omit one ‘negate’ Classen has,
ε, however, collected several apposite examples of the repetition of an

,ζ’ἱιιὶρετεῑίνε before‘ inquam, 'and the loss of the repeated word is very

gflkely to have occurred in transcription.

In eo loco, i. e. ‘where you sit! A, B, D, and several other MSS.
Εἰ have ‘meo loco,' and so Baiter. Classen retains the vulgate, and
rightly3 for Manutius has correctly interpreted‘ in eo loco' to signisy
f -the ‘subsellia accusatorum! The impeachers‚ it would appear, were
1 prohibited from addressing or interrupting the counsel for the defendant
ᾖ, ¹ unless upon his invitation. We have an excellent illustration in the
Ξ speech Pro Rosc. Amer. 27, §73
’ ‘lta quaero abs te, C. Eruci, quomodo? et sic tecum agam, ut in eo
ff loco² vel respondendi, vel interpellandi tibi potestatem faciam, vel
-Ψ etiam, si quid voles, interrogandi:
-ἓ Below, 60, ξ 168‚‘ ex illo loco’ bears the same meaning; above, 19,
,ζ ς 54. ⁴ hoc ipso in loco' denotes the ‘ subsellia reorum! See note.

{3⁹³ 8. Quod repetistis, . . . quod abstulistis. This refers to the
J recovery of the money from Staienus—a transaction described at the end
’ of Chapter 28. Some of the earlier commentators have entirely
mistaken the meaning of this passage.
²4. 'rantum datis muneribus perfecerat. So A, Β, Class.‚ and
⁷ Baiter. All other MSS. and edd. have ‘donis datis muneribusque! lt
’ hay be difficult to establish any clear distinction between ‘dona' and

‘munera,’ but we find the two words combined at the end of Chapter
66 “ donis, muneribus . . . obstrinxit ς’ where Classen has retained ‘mune-
ribus? although there is MS. authority sor a good various reading,
⁸ muliebribus: and himself remarks that these two words are frequently
joined. In the passage before us edd. in general have not been offended

  

¹ An MSS. have here ‘in eo loco,' and 211 edd. except Baiter, who hat
introduced ‘meo loco' in deserence to Madvig (Opuse. 1. p. 122).
