13. Taciti cogitationi, διο. ‘Contraria taciti cogitationi subiicere' =

is mentally to call up facts or arguments which seem to' invalidate the ’
‘reasonings of an advocate, and thus silently to place ourselves in ¹
opposition to him—a process with which every one who has listened γ
to a pleader with whom he does not perfectly agree, is familiar, and ¹¹<
which, to a certain extent, both distracts the hearer and places him ¹
in antagonism, as it were. to the orator. Cicero implores the jurors ¹
not to give way to any such feeling, but to hear him patiently to the
end, and then, aster he shall have concluded his discourse, if any point
of importance should appear to have been passed over, they will be .
free to note the defect and mentally to demand that it should be supplied
(animo requirere). The general force of the passage will be—Do not
mentally admit any impression unfavourable to my cause until you ’ξ
have heard me fairly to the end, and then if I shall appear to have
omitted anything, to have blinked any portion of the charge, mark q
the defect and turn it to my disadvantage if you will—Classen says— '
‘Animo requirere nihil aliud est, quam quod modo dixerat, tacitum ³
cogitationi subiicere.- quod enim inter ipsam defensionem iudices facere J
vetuit orator, id ut faciant absoluta oratione, hortatur.’ But this ex·- ’,
planation appears to me to be neither quite distinct nor absolutely J]
correct.
A few MSS. have ‘ a me requiratis! a reading adopted by Lambinus ,
and all succeeding editors down to Orelli. Baiter quotes from the ,
papers of Garatoni, ‘Neque α me neque animo adesse velim: satis est ’
requiratis. Certe causa perorata testes interrogabantur, non defensor. j
Suspicor a me esse glossema ad v. praeteritum, deinde animo subiectum ex »ᾖ
praecedente cogitatione! The objection applies to ‘ a me ’ only and not
to ‘ anim0‚’ the force of which we have endeavoured to explain. Even ¹²
if we read ‘a me’ we cannot suppose that Cicero meant to invite the s.
jury to call upon him to supply the defects in his speech after the -
pleadings were concluded. ¹
sed ad extremum. So all MSS. and edd. except A, B, and >

Class„ who omit ‘ad‚' Baiter retains it. The insertion or omission ,.

of the preposition is of little or no importance, but it seems more natural 't
to retain it. In the next clause C has ‘meque' and so Class. A, B, ,

‘me’ without the conjunction, all other MSS. and edd. ‘et me’ with ⁷·

the exception of one MS. which has ‘ut me,' an evident error. This 25¹·
example will serve to show how the lists of various readings become „-

to from the opposite side,’ i. e. is known only from the representations
of my opponents. A few MSS. and editions have ‘ auditur: but Cicero ἓ
