PREFAGE To THE FJRST ΕυιΤῙοΝ. vii

assumed a form which I did not originally contemplate;
and, after many years of experience in the communication
of knowledge, I have been induced to hope that my labours,
presented in a modified shape, may prove useful to others
as well as to myself.

The most important editions of this speech, in so far as
the text is concerned, are those of Orelli (Zurich, 1826),
which presents what may be termed the Vulgate Recension
under its most correct form, and that of Classen (Bonn,
1831), who introduced many changes on the faith of two
MSS„ described more particularly in the Introduction. The
text of the present edition is the result of a careful com-
parison of the two above named¹. In some cases Ι have
adopted the changes introduced by Classen, and in many
others Ι have preferred the common reading. The notes
appended to the edition of Classen are, for the most part,
purely critical, explaining and defending his alterations of
the Vulgate, and are so remarkable for acuteness and good
scholarship, that it is not without great diffidence, and the
sear that 1 am exposing myself to a charge of presumption,
that 1 have ventured to differ· from him on several points
of considerable importance ². 1t appears to me that,

¹ 1 have spoken more fully of the different editions of this speech in
the Introduction.

² 1 would refer more particularly to the following passages in the
Commentary, most of which relate to proposed changes in the text, but

ἶῗζί a few to explanations also of sentences in which there is no difference of
- opinion as to the reading.
