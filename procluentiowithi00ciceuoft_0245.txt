¹ 4. Perfer. Most edd. have ‘et perfer‚' but the great majority of
j MSS. omit ‘et.'
3 18. Inimicitias enim inter ipsos. A, B, omit ‘inter ipsos: The
⁵ words are retained by class„ and bracketed by Baiter.

19. Aut quod metuunt, aut quod oderunt. So all the MSS.
except a few which have the corruption ‘ut.' Lambinus introduced

’ ·, “vel . . . vel‚’ which is certainly more appropriate, but it is unsafe, in
’ ’ such circumstances, to depart from the MSS. where they are unanimous

⁷ A, B, Lambinus, class„ and Bait„ have ⁸ eos metuunt‚’ but ‘ eos’ is
’ ouiitted in all other MSS.

’ 25. Exsulis testimonio. An ‘ Exsul ’ was ⁸ ipso sacto ’ incapable of
giving evidence—he was civilly dead.

J 26. Inimicum. So A, B. The great majority of MSS. omit ‘in-
= amicum?

⁷ 30. Nemo adire . . . respicere. Here we depart from the MSS.,
’ which all agree in ‘audires The correction, which was made at an
’ early period, may be regarded as certain. The climax evident in ‘re-
· cipere '—‘ adire '—‘ alloqui'—‘respicere‚' would be destroyed by the
: substitution of ‘audire’ See note on 14, ξ 41, where we have a similar
’ display of rhetoric, but pushed much farther.

¹ Instead of ‘respicere’ A, B, have ‘adspicere‚’ which is adopted by
.= Classen, who says—⁴ Respicere quamquam in longe plerisque MSS.
ff legitur, plane huius loci non est '—but in this. it appears to me, he is
⁷ quite mistaken. ‘Adspicere' may undoubtedly signify ¹ to look at an
object designedly and with a purpose‚’ but it is also frequently employed
⁷ iu such phrases as ‘ adspicere aliquem,’ ⁶ adspicere lucem‚’ simply in the
sense ‘to see,' without implying any exercise of the will; while, on the

² other hand, ‘ respicere aliquem' necessarily implies a deliberate act.

Ῑ This distinction is illustrated by the following clause from Cic. De
Divin. 1. 33, where he is telling a story about Dionysius—‘ Quum autem
aliquantulum progressus esset, subito exaudivit hinnitum, respexitque et

³ equum alacrem adspexit '-—here the ‘respexit ¹ expresses the voluntary
,⁷ ς, act, ‘ adspexit’ the result which was involuntary. Hence, in the present
.’ί passage, where we have a choice between ⁸ respicere' aud ⁸ adspicere?
{275 ¹ and where the weight of testimony is greatly in favour os the former, we
ἒξ, ., cannot hesitate to prefer it.
