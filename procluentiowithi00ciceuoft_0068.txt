Delphin edition, and he has noted between 160 and 170
various readings. Of these about sixty belong to Classes Ι,
II, 111; about fifty to classes 1V‚—-V111; about eleven to
Class IX; twelve‚ although not blunders, are so decidedly
inferior that they may be rejected without hesitation3 so that
out of the whole number four-fifths may at once be set aside,
while in inferior MSS. the proportion is very much greater.
In addition to the various readings which admit of regular
classification, the critical scholar knows well that certain
words, from the resemblance which they bear to each other,
constantly give rise to great apparent, but little real per-
plexity. Thus, such words as ‘(h)ominum',’ ‘ominum,’
‘omnium’—‘(h)ominibus¹,' ‘ominibus‚' ‘omnibus,’ are sre-
quently confounded. There can be scarcely a doubt that
the last two words in Chapter 5 are correctly exhibited in
our text as——‘ ominibus omnium 3’ but, upon comparing MSS.
and early editions, we find them represented as—‘omnibus
omnium’—-‘ hominibus omnium'—‘ omnibus ominum ’--‘ cri-
minibus omnium’—‘ omnibus hominibus hominum '—‘ omnibus
omnium ominibus’—‘ omnibus omnium omnibus’—-‘ ominibus
omnium omnibus’-‘omnibus’ alone—‘ ominibus’—alone.
Moreover, it must be remembered that the most ancient
MSS. were all written in capitals and continuously, that is,
without regular punctuation and without separation of words.
There were numerous abbreviations introduced, some of them
common and universally recognized, such as a small horizontal
line placed above a vowel to represent m or n, others peculiar
to the individual scribe. By paying attention to these matters,
we can explain the origin of many various readings which, at
first sight, appear to bear no resemblance to each other. 1f
we wished to enlarge upon this topic, it would be necessary
to have types cut so as to present exact fac-similes of the
characters found in MSS„ many of which resemble each
other more closely than the characters now in use, and

² The aspirate is constantly omitted in MSS.
