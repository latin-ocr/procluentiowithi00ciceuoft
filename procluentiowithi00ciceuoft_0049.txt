Sncr. 1 1.—The Result ffthe Trial.

Cluentius was acquitted, although guilty, for Cicero, as we
are told by Qintilian (1. Ο. 2. 17, 21), subsequently boasted
that he had thrown dust into the eyes of the jury—‘nec Ci-
cero, QUUM SE TENEBRAS oFFUDISSE IvmclBUs ΙΝ CAUSA
CLUENTn emmiu-us Es'r, nihil ipse vidit!

We are destitute of any source of information which might
enable us to dispute the facts stated by Cicero, but we shall
have no difficulty in detecting a palpable fallacy in his reason-
ing on one of the most important points of the case.

In Chapter 23, when about to enter upon the details by
which he would prove that Oppianicus had endeavoured to
bribe the jury by which he was tried, we find the following
proposition enunciated 2—-

‘ Unum quidem certe nemo erit tam iniquus Cluentio qui
mihi non concedat, si constet, corruptum illud esse iudicium,
aut ab Habito, aut ab Oppianico esse corruptum. Si doceo,
non ab Habito, vinco ab Oppianico: si ostendo, ab Oppianico,
purgo Habitum.'

Qintilian (1. Ο. 5. 10, 68) quotes these words apparently
with praise‚ as an example of what rhetoricians frequently
term a dilemma, But the escape from the horus is by no
means difficult. Cicero argues, that since it was undeniable
that bribery had been resorted to upon the trial in question,
it must have been employed either by Habitus or by Oppiani-
cuS, and, consequently, that to prove the innocence of Clu-
entius would be to establish the guilt of Oppianicus; or, to
prove the guilt of Oppianicus, would be to establish the inno-
cence of Habitus. Now, if he could have proved, by direct
evidence, the innocence of Habitus, nothing more was neces-
sary sor his case; this he does not attempt, and merely urges
some plausible a priori probabilities, while he exerts all his
power in proving the guilt of Oppianicus; and, having suc-
ceeded in this, claims credit for having triumphantly established
