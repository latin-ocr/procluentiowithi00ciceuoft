construction of ‘adscendere’ without ‘in‚' see De Divin. 1. 28, 58,
Amicit. 23. 88, Caes. B. G. 1. 21. .

21. Hane ipsam legem, m: Qus, διο. This is the ‘Lex Sempronia ,
spoken of in the following chapter, ξ 154. Both here and there it inv
described as similar in its provisions to that part of the ⁸ Lex Comelia⁸
which treated of judieial corruption, and therefore applicable to senatore
only. We must suppose that this law was passed by C. Gracchus ’πίοις-
he carried his ‘ Lex 1udiciaria‚’ by which the right of acting as jurors was
transferred from the Senate to the Equestrian order: sor it would-4
manifestly have been absurd to have passed a law sor the suppression of
judicial corruption in a body, the members of which were debarred from
exercising the functions of jurors, unless, indeed, we suppose it to have
applied to the presiding judge only. 1 am not aware that this law is·
mentioned anywhere except in these passages.

P. 124. 1. 1. Omnem illam acerbitatem proscriptionis mae 3·
The meaning seems to be—If Sulla could have ventured to extend tho
application of his new law so as to make it retrospective‚ he ννοιιὶιὶ14
gladly have concentrated the whole severity os his persecution of 111ςῖ
old jurors (the members of the Equestrian order) upon this newv
‘Quaestio:' i.e. he would have made this new ‘ Quaestio' the instru-v
ment of wreaking his vengeance upon the Equestrian order, which hg:
abhorred. ἶ

Qua est. usus. This' 1s a conjectural emendation of Manutius. Au-
the MSS. have either‘ quaestus' or ‘.'questus ¹

3. Nee nuno quicquam agitur. See note on 54, § 148. v

14. Si constitutum est. So all MSS. and earlier edd. But most 4
recent edd. before Classen, following Lambinus, have ‘ si sit constitutum: 's
which is less appropriate, for the indicative here denotes the certainty?
felt by the persons referred to, that their wishes would be accomplishcffl¹
Baiter has ⁴ sit.' «

Qui rem iudicarent. This also is the reading of all MSS„ and will&
indicate generally the class of men acting as jurors. Orelli and δοιαὶ
other edd. have‘ iudieaxint: which is perhaps more emphatic, since ἦε·
would imply that‘ all who had at any time acted in the capacity οἰκ·
jurors 'would be liable to p1osecuti0n.> Ἰ

2 3 M. Druso, tribuno plebis, restiterunt. M. Livius Drusus]
when Tribune of the Plebs, 91 1³..‚c introduced, among his σῶαι
measures, a ‘Lex Iudiciaria: which appears to have consisted of tw}
parts. The object of the first part was to effect a compromise between ,
the Senate and Equestrian order in regard to the ⁶ Iudicia.’ It provided
that three hundred new members should be added to the Senate, all ο z:
whom were to be selected from the Equestrian order, and that out ι»
