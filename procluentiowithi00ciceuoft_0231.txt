A} mg. BSed errat. vehementer, &c. Cicero, surely, makes a grave

ῗ· mistake when he adopts such a line of apology. It is a serious error in
{r' iudgment to urge, in this place, that pleaders must be allowed a certain
ἒ] degree of license, and must be permitted to dress up their statements so
{55 as to meet the exigencies of the cause in hand. For, although this is
⁵⁴3? very true, and although every one knows that this takes place, yet when
· Α the jury were reminded of it during the course of the trial, their con-
·· , fidence in the representations which the advocate was actually making

. must have been shaken—they could scarcely avoid applying the principle,
here laid down, to the speech he was delivering as well as to former
³. orations. It seems clear that the orator ought to have confined himself
’χ to the plea indioeted at the close of the next chapter, namely, that he
⁵ had spoken upon former occasions according to the voice of popular
³ report, without having himself investigated the facts, but that a careful
2 inquity into these had sully convinced him, that the opinions so hastily
‘s adopted were erroneous. This would have been reasonable and satis-
“ faetory. Cicero was probably led away by his extreme sensitiveness.

Latine dicendi copiam aequatam? He then proceeds to give the
characteristies of each, and to compare their powers.

Meyer, in his ⁴ Oratorum Romanorum fragmenta’ (Turic. 1842), has
collected all the testimonies of ancient authors concerning Antonius
and Crassus, together with the few fragments which have been preserved
os their speeches.
