ζ’ Au. the best MSS of this speech uniformly exhibit the name of the

defendant under the form Habitus, or Abieus, and so, sor the most part,
do au the bes t MSS. of Quintilian. Such also was the reading of all
s'* the early editions, but Lambinus (1566) introduced Avitus, at the
suggestion of Cuiacius. who believed that this was the reading m the
famous Florentine MS. of the Pandects (48. 19. 39), and accordingly

’ Auitus was admitted by subsequent editors, down to Orelli inclusive.
’ Upon closer inspection it was found‘ that, after all, the reading in the
⁴ florentine MS. of the Pandects is not Avitus but Abieus, that is Habitus

with the aspirate dropped, an omission extremely common in like cases

in old MSS. Habitus as a Roman name is found in the Fasti Capitolini.

and Absens in an inscription published by Fulvius Ursinus. Niebuhr
(Rhein. Mus. 1. 3, p. ²²3) seems first to have called attention to the
real state of the case. Habitus has been adopted by Classen, Baiter.
and others, and will probably be received by all future editors.

Quarum altera . . .alt·‚era tantummodo. It would seem that
‘alter-a. „altera' are both in the ablative‚ the nominative to ‘vide-

batur· being· accusator.' The Turin Palimpsest has ‘alteram tantum-
Μαάθ] but the vulgate is much better.

3. Invidia iam inveterata. Here andin many other passages in
this speech invidia' signifies‘ ill-will arising from prejudice,’ and may
in most cases be fairly translated simply by the word ‘ prejudice.’

‘Invidia inveterata' is prejudice which has taken deep root in con·
sequence of having been long eherished undisturbed.
