was to secure to his son, young Oppianicus, and therefore
virtually to himself, the lad being very young, the whole
inheritance of Dinaea. (8.)

7. Being threatened with impeaehment by A. Aurius (π),
a kinsman of the deceased, he fled from Larinum, joined the
party of Sulla, and taking advantage of the proscriptions, put
to death A. Aurius (π), Α. Aurius Melinus (ξ), Caius Aurius
(o), son of the latter, and a certain Sext. Vibius who had
been privy to the murder of M. Aurius (κ). (8, 9.)

8. He now sought to marry Sassia (θ), the wealthy widow
of A. Aurius Melinus (ξ). She objected because he was
burdened with three sons. One of these boys, by a (divorced)
wife named Papia, was living with his mother at Teanum
Apulum, eighteen miles from Larinum. Another son, still an
infant, had been borne him by a wife named Novia, who
must have been divorced or dead ¹. Both of these children
he murdered within ten days of each other, and having thus
removed the scruples of Sassia, married her. The third son
spoken of must have been young Oppianicus (B)². By this
union Oppianicus became the stepfather‚ ‘ vitricus‚’ of Cluentius

(εν. (14.)

¹ Probably dead; for while much is said of the grief of Papia, no
notice is taken of Novia.

² We find in some of the ‘Arguments ' prefixed to this speech—that
in the edition of Lemaire, for example—that Oppianicus killed his three
sons. Cicero says that Sassia objected to marry him because he had
three sons; but the murder of two of thern seems to have sufficed to
remove her scruples.

⁸ On the trial of Scamander, Canutius used the expression (19)—
‘Oppianici hominis in uxoribus necandis exercitati! We hear of six
wives in this speech who succceded each other, probably in the fol-
lowin order :—

1. {uam (ν), daughter of Dinaea (ι). Magia died, and left a son,
the younger Oppianicus (β). 7.

2. Cuma-rm (η), sister of the elder Cluentius (δ). 10.

3. The widow of his brother-in-law Numeiius Magius (μ). 10, 11, 12.

4. Puni, from whom he was divorced. 9.

5. Nom, whose child was still an infant when put to death along
with the son of Papia.
