mder that he might soften the hearts of all beholders by his miserable
aspect. If we are to draw a distinction between ‘ squalore’ and ‘ sor·
dibus,' the former will refer to the neglected state of the hair, sace.
ἃς.. the latter to the filthy and beggarly dress-but this is perhaps

sauxcffffuil'l'emere a. nobis illam appellari putatote. Here ‘appellare’

is used in the sense ‘to accuse‚’ ‘to attack3’ we have another example
in Cic. de Off. 1, 25, § 89

‘Cavendum autem, ne maior poena quam culpa sit, et ne iisdem
de causis alii plectantur, alii ne appellentur quidem?
· 14. Sin erunt. So A, B, C. Almost all MSS. and edd„ except
Classen and Baiter, have ‘sin autem erunt.' The difference is scarcely
worth noticing.

21. Vi ac necessitate. So A, Β, and several MSS. Many others
have ‘vi et necessitate? A like variation is found below (ξ 20), in
'oculis ac manibus: where A, Β, have ‘ oculis et manibus.' We shall

“ not notice such discrepancies again, but we may state generally that

it will be found impossible, without entirely rejecting the authority
of MSS„ to establish any well-defined principle of distinction between
‘ac’ and ‘et,' in so sar as the signification of the words connected is
concerned. The common rule which forbids the use of ‘ac’ before a
word beginning with a vowel, or with ‘c' or ‘q,’ seems to be closely
observed.

23. Deprehendisset. See note on 19, ξ 53.

30. Evitaret. So A, B, and Class. Most MSS. and edd. have the
simple form ‘vitaret‚' which is in itself unobjectionable; but ⁶ evitaret'
will give greater soree to the expression, since i't will indicate that
Cluentius took the strong step os impeaching his own step-father, in
order that he might escape ‘at once and for ever’ from the danger by
which he was threatened.

P. 67. 1. 1. nlius iudicii. The trial of Oppianicus.

3. Ad Staienum. Here, as in almost all places where uncommon
proper names occur, the MSS. present a great variety os forms. A, B,
have ‘Scaienum ⁸—0thers ‘Stalenum‚' which has been adopted by many
edd.—C, and several others have ‘Staienum,’ and this seems on the
whole most likely to be the true form.

5. Eum. Magium. Many MSS. have here and elsewhere in this
speech, ·Cn. Magium? It is almost unnecessary to remark that, in
this md similar cases, such variations are os no importance.

7. captu: apud Asculum. Asculum Picenum, the chief town of
the Piceni, situated on the right bank of the Truentus (Troum), less
than twenty miles from its mouth. There is a medem Ascoli of⁴
