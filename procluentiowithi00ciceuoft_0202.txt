reflection, it will be seen that Classen is right; for in no way could ι -·
jurors be said to be leaders or guides in an investigation‚ the mysteri
of which were to be disclosed to them by the orator himself, who
exults that times were now changed, and that he would be able, befo ¹
a distinguished jury (vobis iudicibus), to bring forward conclusi· ·;
evidence which, at a former period, would not have been listened to.
Compare 33, ξ 88 ‘ ut hodierno die primurn . . . veritas vocem . . . his ⁷
iudicibus freta miserit?

6. At enim Staienus. Here, and in a multitude of other passages, ς’
‘at enim’ is employed to introduce an objection which is anticipated- '
and refuted. So at the commencement of the next chapter ‘At enim, ’
pecuniam‚’ &c. The simple ‘at’ is frequently employed in the same&
manner, as, a few lines lower down, ‘ At condemnavit! Every speech of , ·
Cicero will afford numerous examples.

8. Quum in consilium iretur, . . . quum in consilium mittebant. ·
See note on 20, ξ 55, and compare 27, ξ 74. See also below, ‘ sine 2
Staieno ne in consilium iretur? ³

10. Cui pecuniam dederant. So the great majority of MSS. with· ¹
out any variation. A has ‘eui quod,’ B simply ‘quod.' Classen. ³
without any authority or necessity, has introduced into his text ‘qui =
pecuniam dederant‚' and is followed by Baiter. j

1 1. Oppianicus quaerebat.. The MSS. are divided between ‘quaere- ²
bat ’ and ⁸ querebatur.’ Most edd. have adopted the former: A, B, E. ¹
Class, and Bait. have the latter. ‘ Quaerebat' seems to accord better⁴ Ἰ
with ⁸ flagitabat.‘ Oppianicus was seeking Staienus, Quintius was 1
clamouring for him. ’

15. 1stin0 . . .istinc‚ &c., i. e. ‘from that side '--‘ ab Oppianico.’ v

18. Nulla. suspicio. So A, Β, Class‚ and Bait. All other MSS. j.
and edd. have ‘et nulla,' but the omission of the conjunction gives '¹
additional force. Ῐ’“

25. Ad conciliationem gratiae, i. e. ⁴ for the purpose of bringing ‚
about a good understanding between Oppianicus and Cluentius? ,Ι

26. 'reno hoc, Atti, dicere, &c ‘Is it possible that you should
say this ξ’ Here ‘ tene ¹ expresses indignation mixed with astonishment, ¹
as in the exclamation of Juno, Aen. 1. 37

. ‘Mene incepto desistere victam
Nec posse Italia Teucrorum avertere regnal’

and again, 1. 97

‘Mene Iliacis occumbere campis
Non potuisse, tuaque animam hanc effundere dextra?
