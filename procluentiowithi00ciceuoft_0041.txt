persaepe dixisti, sic tibi renuntiari, me habere in animo
causam hanc praesidio legis defendere.’—He then proceeds
to declare that, although his client might have availed himself
of the terms of the law if he had thought fit, he had absolutely
refused to take shelter under this plea, and had peremptorily
insisted that the charge against him should be fairly and fully
met, desiring nothing so much as a complete investigation of
his character. Cicero goes on to state that, under these

this duty having been discharged‚ he considered it due to

merely as an attempt to bewilder and mystify the jurors.
But this opinion can scarcely be maintained with success.

was exempted from its operation, but not according to the
spirit. The object of Sulla in the Chapter was manifestly to
check the corruption which had, for a long period, notoriously
prevailed among the judges and jurors on criminal trials,
while according to another of his ordinances‚ the right of
serving as jurors was restored to the senate to the exclusion
