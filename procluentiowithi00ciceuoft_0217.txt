3 ἶ] 19. Ad talos demissam purpuram. This passage gave rise to an
Δ ' ·imated controversy between Rubenius, Ferrarius, and the other leading
j ’ ‘ters ‘De re Vestiaria.' It cannot reasonably be doubted that
,ζ ¹. cicero here indicates the ‘ Toga Praetexta ' by the word ‘ purpura,’ and
ιο the passage was understood by Quintilian (Ι. Ο. 5. 13, 5 39), ‘ut
j ἶ’ῃιίνεπειιε Quintium Cicero, non haec solum, sed ipsam etiam praetextam
’ demissam ad talos, insectatus est! Hence the conclusion that the
“ ‘Tribunae of the Plebs wore the ‘Toga Praetexta. ‘ But Plutarch in his
Roman Questions positively asserts that they did not, and this seems to
confirmed by an expression in the Interrogatio in Vatinium, 7, ξ 16.
Upon examining the passage before us, however, it will be seen that
‘Cicero is not speaking of the conduct of Quintius in his Tribunate,
during which he enjoyed uninterrupted popularity‚ but of his arrogance
ἦα a subsequent period (postea), when, by the exertions of his sup-
· ² porters, he had climbed to a higher position (in altiorem locum ad-
= scenderat), i. e. to the Curule Aedileship or to the Praetorship‚ either of
2 which offiees‚ beyond dispute, entitled the holder to wear the‘ Toga
, , Praetexta: This is the explanation suggested by Rubenius, and it
,’ appears satisfactory.
ᾗ ’ζ ²4· Ubi, si quis . . . ita vivit. So A, Β, and most MSS. Orelli

3. Ἴ hoc uno nititur: where there is no controversy.
ἱ, v v 31. Intolerantia, i.e. ‘ insufserable arrogance! This word, in Cicero
and the best writers, seems to be always employed in the passive sense.
«ᾗ In later authors, such as Aulus Gellius, it is used actively to denote
¹ ’ ·impatienee.’

⁶ omnibus,' and is followed by Classen. Baiter brackets the word. ἱ
