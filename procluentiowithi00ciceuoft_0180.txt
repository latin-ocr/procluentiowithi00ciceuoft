'sole executor, and was bound to pay it. Hence, a testator was said to
bequeath a legacy (legare) ΑΒ Hmum. In the present case, Num. g
Magius bequeathed his fortune, in the first instance, to the son whom “’
he expected to be born, and left a large legacy to his widow, to be paid
by that son, as executor, if he sueceeded. F ailing a son, he bequeathed
his property to his nephew, the younger Oppianicus; but in this case j
the widow was to receive nothing. The heir named first in a will was
termed ‘Primo gradu scriptus heres;' or, as Cicero here calls him,
*Secundus heres.’ There might be any number of these ⁴ Heredes
substituti' named in successim, and hence the expressions ‘Heres'
substitutus secundo’—‘ tertio'—‘ quarto,’ &c.‚ ⁴ gradu.’ ·

²4- Si qui natus esset. Here and a few lines lower down (ξ 34),
where the same expression occurs, A, B, have ‘ en't'—if this is true, we
must suppose that Cicero is giving the very words of the will without
secking to combine them with the construction of his sentence.

25. Quid de Oppianico suspicatus sit . . . quid iudicarit . . .

‘ Suspicari’ is ⁴ to sui-mise ' (generally something evil)——‘ Iudicare ' is ‘to ’
form a deliberate opinion! The suspicions forebodings of Magius were
indicated by the singular provision in his will—his deliberate opinion
of Oppianicus by the fact that he did not name him as a guardian of
the child whom he expected to be born.

26. Nam, quum eius filium faceret heredem. A, B, C, Class.,
and Baiter have ‘Nam cuius filium‚’ in which case the ‘cum' in the
apodosis follows more naturally. But it seems very doubtful whether
‘faceret' in the subjunctive could follow ‘cuius,' and the examples
quoted by Classen as parallel certainly do not apply.

28. 'Ut illum Magium intelligatis longe animo prospexisse
‘morientem- So all MSS. and edd.‚ except A, B, and Class.‚ which
have ‘ut illum Magium intelligatis non longe,’ &c. The introduction
of ‘ non' may unquestionably be defended, and may be interpreted so as
to give additional force to the passage, although this, at first sight, is
not obvious. Magius entertained some apprehensions of foul play on
the part of OppianicuS, and took such measures as he thought would

ὲ baffle him. ‘But‚’ says Cicero, ‘mark what Oppianicus did, in· order

that you may understand that Magius, after all, was but short-sighted.'
If Magius had seen clearly what was likely to follow his death, he
'would have taken more effectual precautions against the villany of
Oppianicus. As matters turned out, he did not see far (or at least far
enough) before him, and hence the schemes of Oppianicus proved suc-
cesssul.

This is the explanation given by Classen, and it is most ingenious
and acute. It may be doubted, however, whether such a meaning is
