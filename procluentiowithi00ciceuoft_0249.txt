„ §3 177-181ι NOTES. 237

6. Velle atque optare . . . struere et moliri. ‘Velle' indicates
a passive condition of mind, ‘optare’ the active formation of a wish.
g Sassia would not only have been well pleased if misfortune had besallen
' her son, but she longed that some calamity might overtake him.
‘struere’ is to make arrangements and preparations for carrying
out an object, ‘ moliri ’ to make a strong effort to accomplish a. purpose
-* at once. See below, 76, ξ 188 ‘ voluerit; optaverit3 cogitaverit;

effecerit.’

· 7. Hortensio, Q„ Metello oonsulibus. The praenomen ‘ Q? is
Ἠ found in every MS.. but is omitted by most edd. before Classen, sor the
.· sake of symmetry apparently, because it is not attached to the name
3 of Hortensius also. But it is evidently inserted here to prevent con-
fusion, sor Q. Metellus was Consul along with Hortensius in 69 B.c.,
³ and L. Metellus was Consul the year following along with Marcius
, Rex.

Ὗ 10. Despondit* ei filiam suam. Donatus on Terence (Andr. ι.
⁴> ι, 75) says that ‘Spondere' is properly used with reference to the
” father of the bride, ‘ Despondere’ to the father of the bridegroom, a
. distinction certainly not universally‚ or even generally observed. Here
⁴ ‘despondere’ is used with reference to the mother of the bride, and
ἶ in a letter from Coelius to Cicero we find a still wider departure from
the grammatical canon—‘ Cornificius adolescens Orestillae filiam sibi
’· doepondit’ (Epp. ad Fam. 8. 7).

² 15. Nummorum . . . auri. The former is ‘coined money,’ the latter
3 ‘bullion.' This is evident from the next sentence. ,

¹ 18. ΠΒ **. The number has fallen out of the MSS.. and we have
¹ no means of restoring it.

25. Dentatam. The MSS. have ·dentium’ or ‘dentuml The true
Ῑ reading is preserved in Priscian. 3. 7, 42. We find the word again
in Pliny (H. N. 36. 22)—

- ‘In Liguria quoque, Umbn'a et Venetia, albus lapis dentata serra
’ secatur?

”’ 27. A coactoribus. ‘Coactor' corresponds, in most caseS, to the

” .’ English word collector. The ‘coactores’ here spoken of vwere the

{j ἦ s. 1. 6, 8⁶

 

’ζ persons employed to collect the money due for goods purchased at
, auctions. This was the profession followed by the father of Horace—-

‘Si praeco parvas, aut, ut fuit ipse, coactor
Mercedes sequerer . . .'

P. 186. 1. 5. Cui probatis? i. e. ‘ Whom do you persuade to believe
. this ?—To whose satisfaction do you establish this Υ See above,

g? ass.
