to Cluentius; and he took the advice of an intimate friend,
M. Baebius, a senator of high character. By the advice of
Baebius, Cluentius purchased Diogenes from Cleophantus, in
order that he might be. more at his disposal should his
evidence be required. A few days afterwards, in the presence
of witnesseS,⁴ placed in concealment for the purpose, the
poison, and a sum of money, sealed up as the reward of
Diogenes, were seized in the hands of Scamander, a freed-
man of Fabricius. (15, 16.)

Cluentius now impeached Scamander-3 the prosecution was
conducted by P. Canutius; the defence was undertaken by
Cicero, at the earnest request of some friends, respectable
inhabitants of Aletrium3 Caius Iunius, assistant judge, ‘iudex
quaestionis‚’ presided at the trial. The whole circumstances
of the case were fully laid open, implicating both Fabricius
and Oppianicus, and the facts were established by unquestion-
able evidence. The votes of the jurors were given by ballot,
and Scamander was found guilty, with only one dissentient
ticket, which was claimed by C. Aelius Staienus, a senator of
doubtful reputation. (17-20, 24.) ⁴

This verdict‚ says Cicero, was given nominally against
Scamander, in reality against Oppianicus. Cluentius, how-
ever, did not yet attack his stepfather, but next impeached
C. Fabricius, whose trial, in consequence of its close con-
nection with the preceding case, was allowed to come on
immediately. Canutius again conducted the prosecution,
the jurors were the same, and Iunius was again the judge,
but neither Cicero nor the townsmen of Aletrium came
forward to support the accused. Fabricius, without waiting
for the close of the trial, slunk out of court, and was found
guilty unanimously. (21, 24, 38.)

Last of all Cluentius proceeded to impeach Oppianicus,
whose guilt had, in reality, been fully demonstrated in the
trials of his associates. Iunius was again presiding judge, and
the jurors were, apparently, with one or two exceptions, the
same who had previously convicted Scamander and Fabricius
