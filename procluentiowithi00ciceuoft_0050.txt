the innocence of Habitus. But he carefully keeps out of
view a third hypothesis, viz. that both parties might have
employed bribery, and this, in all likelihood, was the truth.
We have seen in a quotation from the Verrine'Orations
(Act. 1. 13), given in the last section, that Cicero himself
boldly asserted that a Senator (Staienus) had been found,
who, when acting as a crimina} juror, had, in one and the
same trial, received money from the accused to procure an
acquittal, and from the prosecutor to secure a conviction.
Nay, more, from the passage, quoted also in the last section,
from the Oration Pro Caecina, we may perhaps infer the
precise sum given by Cluentius. Fidiculanius Falcula, one of
the suspected jurors, when examined in the cause of Caecina,
was asked how many thousand, ‘quot millia,¹’ his farm was
distant from the city, and on replying, ‘less than fifty-three,’
a shout arose among the audience that that was the correct*
number, ‘ipsa esse,’ for they remembered, says Cicero, the
amount of what he had received at the trial of Oppianicus.
Now, we learn from the speech for Cluentius that the sum
for which Oppianicus had bargained with Staienus was 40,000
sesterces for each of sixteen jurors, and, consequently‚ if
Cluentius offered 50,000‚ the next round number lower than

53, ‘minus L111,’ he outbid Oppianicus by 10‚000 sesterces
a-head‚ and thus gained his object.

What may be termed the Common or Vulgate Text of this
speech is that which, having been gradually moulded into
form by the scholars of the fifteenth‚ sixteenth, and seventeenth
centuries, among whom, in so far as Cicero is concerned,
Lambinus (1566) holds the first place, was further elaborated
by Graevius, Ernesti, Schfitz‚ and others, until it appeared

to fill up the ellipse with ‘ Sestertiorum!
