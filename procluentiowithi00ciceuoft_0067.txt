IN TR OD UC'TI ΟΝ. 55

§ 21. ‘iudex'—‘index.'

§ 24. ‘nimis ’——‘ minis?

§ 2 5. ‘impetratum ’—‘ imperatum?
„ ‘ dilationem ’—‘ delationem?

§ 30. ‘peculium '-——‘ poculum.’

Under this class we may rank also words omitted in one or
two MSS. only, where such words are essential. One of the
Munich MSS„ marked n by Classen, abounds in such mistakes.
Thus—

§ 13. ‘sine scelere’ L

‚‚ ‘maerore et lacrimis’ ‚ , ,
§ 19· ι coactum, are entirely omitted m n.
§ 20. ‘Oppianicum’ - ,ΙΙ

Such omissions occur occasionally in the best MSS„ and
are numerous in B, which is so much relied upon by Classen.

The above sketch will enable the young scholar to under-
stand of what materials the long lists of various readings are
chiefly composed, and his own observation will enable him to
enlarge the number of classes, and to find examples to any
extent. lt will be remarked that Classes 1 and 11, although
suggesting many questions interesting to the philologer and
the grammarian, in no way affect the meaning, or even the
‘ipsissima verba' of the author-3 that Class 111, consisting as
it does of mere proper names of no historical importance, can
seldom if ever give rise to any grave difficulty; that, although
the arrangement of words in a Latin sentence is frequently a
matter of much importance, such trivial variations as those
noted in Class IV are entirely destitute of weight; that the
readings ranked under Classes V, VI, VII, VIII, although
each case ought to be carefully scrutinized‚ and the testimony
of MSS. caresully balanced, seldom occasion embarmssment,
while those in Class IX almost always admit of easy and
certain determination.

The fragments of this speech contained in the Turin
Palimpsest were collated by Peyron, with the text of the
