taking vengeance on Junius, the presiding judge‚ and on the
most obnoxious of the conspirators-of the strong resolution
passed by the Senate—of the notorious fact that certain of
the jurors upon that trial had, when accused of other offences,
been at once found guilty solely in consequence of the hatred
with which they were regarded—and of the brand stamped
by the Censors on the character of Cluentius, and of those
who were supposed to have been his chief agents. Hence
it arose that nineteen-twentieths of the reply of Cicero were
devoted to these topics. His principal aim was to impress
upon the jury, and on the public in general, that they had
been grossly deceived; and he strove, by drawing a lively
picture of the life and crimes of Oppianicus and Sassia, to
remove what he calls the ‘inveterata invidia’ against his
client.

But we have seen above that the ‘Lex Cornelia’ contained
a Chapter extending the penalties of the law to those who
should be found guilty of procuring by corrupt practices the
condemnation of an innocent man3 and, had this portion of
the statute been worded like the others, it would have clearly
embraced the charge against Cluentius. But (see p. 26) there
was a clause by which the provisions of this Chapter were
expressly limited to persons who had a seat in the Senate.
Hence, Cluentius, who was of Equestrian rank only, was not
amenable to it; and Cicero maintains that, if he had chosen
to take advantage of this point of law, he might have declined
to say one word with regard to the conduct of his client in
the matter of the trial of Oppianicus. Attius seems to have
imagined that Cicero might take this course, and to have
reprobated it by anticipation3 for Cicero, after having com-
pleted the vindication of Cluentius, turns to Attius and
exclaims (52) :—

de Oppianici damnatione respondi; confiteare necesse est, te
opinionem multum fefellisse, quod existimaris, me causam
