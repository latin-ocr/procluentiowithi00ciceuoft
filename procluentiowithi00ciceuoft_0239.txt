κ γ’ the whole body of the Senate, thus constituted, the ‘ Iudices ’ should sor
- the future be chosen. The second part, which is the portion alluded to

s in the text, provided that criminal proceedings might be taken against
‘Iudices‘ for receiving bribes. The words of Cicero (Pro Rabir. Post.
¹ 7)—‘ M. Druso unam in equestrem ordinem quaestionem serenti, ει Qus
ξ ἴ on m tunicum recusum carlssnr, aperte equites Romani restiterunt’
ι —compared with the passage before us, make it probable that this
ἶ, . *second part of the law was intended to be retrospective in its operation,

j the corruption of the Equites, for some years previous. having been
ν ·’ notorious. Public morality must have been in a frightful state when
ἶ, such a measure was specially called for, and openly resisted upon such
’ -ζ pretexts as those alleged by Cicero.

= The whole of the laws of Drusus were summarily annulled imme-
ὐ diately aster his assassination, on the plea that they had been passed

ss informally.

The principal authorities sor this most obscure section of Roman

’ history are—Cic. de Legg. 2. 6, 12, Pro Cornel. frag. 11, and note of
Asconius. Orat. pro Dom. 16-19‚ Liv. Epit. 70, Velleius 2. 13, Aurel.

s Vic. de Viris Ill. 66, Appian. B. C. 1. 35.
ψ 25. Nobilitate. ‘Nobilitas' has here the same signification as the

Ι English word nubium, viz. ‘ the persons who form the aristocracy!

Ἰ Classen has collected examples from In Verr. Act. 2. 4, 37, ξ 81, Pro
. Rabir. perd. Reo 7. 21, Sallust. lug. 13, Liv. 4. 51 ; 6. 5.

' 28. Huiuscemodi ordinis, This is the reading of most MSS„ but
’ ‘ huiuscemodi' is here quite unintelligible: ⁴ eiuscemodi, ¹ which is found
in A, Β, is no improvement. This portion of the speech is altogether

⁶ wanting in many MSS. Baiter reads—⁸ lobora Populi Romani eques-
’ trisque ordinis? Klotz has — ‘ceterique eiusdem ordinis.

P. 125. l. 7. Amfractu. This word is not found in any MS. but it

is uncertain by whom it was introduced into the text. Classen brackets
= it. Baiter omits it entirely.

10. Potitionem. ‘Petitio’ is here used absolutely to denote ‘the

Δ, act of soliciting from the people a public office;’ but ‘honorum' may
ᾖ» be supplied from the ‘ ad honores petendos ' of the preceding clause.

Iniquum. So nearly all the MSS„ and the word is certainly more

ᾗ ’Ἴ appropriate than ⁸ indignum‚’ which is the common reading.

18. Insignis. This word, although found in all MSS„ has the air

ζ of an interpolation. Baiter brackets both ‘ insignia’ and ‘exercitus'
ζ’ ¹ We find a passage exactly parallel in the speech pro Rabir. Post. 7. 16

‘Delectat amplissimus civitatis gradus, sella curulis, fasces, imperia,

’,- provinciae, sacerdotia, triumphi, denique imago ipsa ad posteritatis
ἶ ξ’· memoriam prodita.'
