int paucis, qui inde eximuntur. Hac eadem ratione infra 67, ξ 190,

2 The English word which represents the meaning of ‘ quod,' when used
h this manner, is ⁵ while.'

10. Iucundius. The MSS. and edd. are pretty equally divided
between ‘iucundius ¹ and ‘iucundum’ A, Β, followed by Classen and
Baiter, have the latter, Orelli the former, which, on the whole, Ι prefer.

24. De eo, quem oderant. So most MSS. and edd. A, Β, have ‘ de ’
eo, quem omnes oderant,’ and are followed by Classen. We feel con-
vinced that ‘omnes’ is out of place, and ought to be omitted. 1t
tppoers perhaps, at first sight, to be scarcely judicious on the part of
Cicero to state that the jurors who tried Oppianicus hated the man on
whose guilt or innocence they were required to decide. But ‘ oderant ’ has

they were gradually becoming filled with detestation of his reckless
vmany, and were arriving at the conclusion that he was ⁸ omni supplicio

and minutely the position occupied by the jurors whom he was ad-
dressing with that which had been occupied by those before whom·
Oppianicus was tried ε·-

Now, it is evident that the caresully maintained contrast exhibited in
