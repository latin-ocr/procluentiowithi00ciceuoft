to ⁴ quaestio ' or to ‘disceptatio ' as well as to ⁴ iudicium· or to all · ’

6. 1110 popqu . . . cui tum mos gestus est. So all MSS. and -·'·e
except A, B, Class., and Bait„ who have ‘cui tum popu10,’ but ⁷ {j
second ⁸ populo ’ is clearly a gloss, for no additional force or distinctus ,
is given by the immediate repetition os the word. ⁴
10. Hac lege . . . qua accusatur Habitus. That is, the ⁸ ,
Cornelia de Sicariis‚' which contained a chapter on the crime' ’
corruptly procuring the condemnation of one innocent. (See-lut ι· ξ.
§5 7, 8.) But it was impossible, says Cicero, that Junius could ham*
been impeached under that law, for that was the very law which ι ι
himself was administering at the time, in the capacity of assistant judge‘
12. Paucos dies exspectasset Quintius. It is very true, contin ss*

19. Interlitus‚ i. e. ‘with words written upon erasures! We have '5
