P. 80. l. 2. mi aetati, qua tum eram. Thirty-three. .

6. Quod timide dicam. Classen remarks—⁴ Haec non modestiae ’
oeusa, ut Sylvius interpretatur, Cicero adiecit, sed quod, in tam turpi .
causa, vix honestum videbatur tantum a se esse praestitum! This view
appears to me altogether erroneous. Roman pleaders frequently refused ’
to undertake the defence of a disreputable client; but when a pleader
had once undertaken a cause, it was held by all that he was bound to
do his best for it, whether good or bad. But Cicero goes farther: he jd
not only says that he actually did his best, but he implies that he made
such exertions that no one could think (⁶ if he might say so without -
presumption') that the advocate had failed to make the most of the
cause.

15. Hominis in uxoribus necandis exercitati. See Introd. ξ 5. ⁷
, 17. Ventura fuisse. So A, B, Class., and Baiter. All other MSS. Ῐ
and edd.‚ ‘ventura esse.' Classen remarks—⁴ Ventura fuisse rescripsi
cum A, B, pro vulg. ventura esse.- necessario: nam Canutius in accusa- 3
tione Scamandri ea tanturn, quae perfecto nefario consilio facta forent,
commemorare potuit, et in ipsa repetitione eorundem verborum, quae ff
modo ad accusandum prolata erant, ludibrium quoddam inest!

ἰ 5. Usu. Several MSS. have ‘usuiff We may, if we please‚ regard „
‘ usu ⁹ as the archaic form of the dative. A, Β, have ‘ usus‚' which is a
manifest error. .

31. P. Quintilius Varus. This is supposed to be the Publius -
Quintilius who was one of the assessors of Aquilius, the arbiter (iudex) v
before whom the cause of Quintius was heard. Pro Quint. 18, ξ 56. ⁴

P. 81. 1. 4. 'Pota accusatione. So Α, B. All other MSS. ‘et tota
accusatione‚' and so all edd. before Classen, who remarks—‘ Verba
tota accusatione cum utroque membro re vera et periculo coniungenda
sunt! However, ‘ et tota accusatione’ gives a good sense.

6. Aderat frequens, i. e. ‘he was constantly in court! So Pro
Rose. Amer. 6, ξ 16

‘ Erat ille Romae frequens atque in foro et in ore omnium quotidie
versabatur! .

Advooabat.. Here and elsewhere ‘advocare ' signifies ‘to call in the
aid of a f1iend‚’ not, as some scholars have rendered <the word in this
passage, ‘to act as an assistant! Observe, however, the peculiar
technical meaning of ‘advocatio,’ which signifies not only the act of .
calling upon friends for assistance in judicial matters, but also ‘ the time
allowed to a defendant for calling together his friends to support him:
and generally, ‘ the time allowed to a defendant to prepare for his trial.'
Hence ‘ advocationes postulare· (Epp. ad F amm. 7, 11) is ‘to demand
postponements.' . ⁴
