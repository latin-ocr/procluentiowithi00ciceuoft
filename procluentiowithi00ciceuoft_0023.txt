commenced his career of crime, and therefore took pre-
cautions to prevent foul play, but these proved unavailing.

ν. ΜΑΕΙΑ, daughter of Dinaea (ι), married the elder Oppi-
anicus, and hence Dinaea is termed ‘ socrus Oppianici.’ Magia
died second of the family of Dinaea, leaving a son, the younger
Oppianicus, the accuser of Cluentius, (7.)

ξ. A. Amuus MELmus, nephew to Sassia (θ), being her
sister’s son. He married his first cousin Cluentia (ζ), divorced
her, and then married his aunt and mother-in-law Sassia. He
was put to death by Oppianicus as one of those proscribed by
Sulla. (5, 8, 9.)

ο. C. AURwS, son of A. Aurius Melinus (ξ), put to death

at the same time with his father. (8.)

π. Α. AURIUS, a kinsman of the Aurii, the children of
Dinaea (ι, κ, λ), characterized by Cicero as ‘vir fortis et
experiens et domi nobilis.’ Intelligence having been received
that Oppianicus was meditating foul play against his newly
discovered brother-in-law‚ Μ. Aurius (κ), this A. Aurius gave
public notice, in the presence of Oppianicus, that, if any evil
should befall M. Aurius, he would impeach Oppianicus. When
the news arrived that M. Aurius was actually dead, A. Aurius
prepared to execute his threat‚ upon which Oppianicus fled
from Larinum and took refuge in the Camp of QMetellus.
After the arms of Sulla had triumphed, Oppianicus returned
to Larinum, deposed the four magistrates elected by the
Municipes, and himself assumed the chief civic authority
along with three others. He then put to death the three
Aurii (ξ, o, π), together with a former tool of his own villany,
a certain Sextus Vibius, declaring that they had all been pro-
scribed by Sulla.

We must carefully distinguish this A. Aurius (π) from A.
Aurius Melinus (ξ). That they are totally different persons
we shall endeavour to demonstrate in a note on Chap. 16.
