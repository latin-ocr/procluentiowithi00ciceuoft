because, he says, the husband of Sassia was not killed by the hand nor ’

in the house of Oppianicus. But this is hypercritical. Oppianicus is
represented as having procured the death of Aurius—⁸ proscribendum
interficiendumque curavit ³—who therefore, without any violent hyper-
bole, might be said to have been murdered by Oppianicus, and the
mansion of the latter might be represented, figuratively, as deluged with
the blood of his victim.

19. Domo sibi quaerendum remedium. ‘That he must seek in
his own family the means of removing the obstacle to his marriage,' i. e.
by the murder of his own children. ·

2 3. 'I'eani Apuli. Teanum Apulum, so called to distinguish it from
Teanum Sidicinum (Teano) in Campania, was situated in Apulia, on
the right bank of the river Frento (Fortore)‚ eighteen miles S.E. from
Larinum. It was at a short distance from a large salt-water lake which
runs far into the land, the Lacus Pantanus (Lago Lesina). The site of
Teanum Apulum has been fixed at a place now called civitate.

A, Β, have ‘ Teano.’ Baiter brackets ‘ Apuli,’ which may be a gloss.

25. Ludis publicis. A, Β, omit ‘ publicis! It is retained by
Classen, and bracketed by Baiter.

32. Familia nuntiavit. So almost every MS. and so Lambinus.
All other edd. from Camerarius (1540) to Orelli have, on the authority
of E, ‘renuntiavit ⁹—a change altogether uncalled for.

P. 70. 1. 6. spe optima confirmato. So au MSS. and edd. except A, Β,
Class.‚ and Bait„ which have ‘ spe optime.’ Classen argues that there
is no question here with regard to the quantity or quality of the hope
entertained by Sassia. The hope she had formed was fixed and definite,
namely‚ the hope of enjoying great wealth and ease if the children of
Oppianicus were removed. Their destruction having been accomplished,
she marries, rejoicing that her hqpe was strengthened and established
in the most satisfactory manner. But, after all, ‘spe optima' may,
without any violence, bear the same meaning, and is more natural.
Lambinus has ‘ confirmata,' which is found in several MSS.

8. Ita quod ceteri. Orelli, following D. E, has ‘itaque ceteri.’
The reading in the text seems to be true. Classen has the following
note :—-

‘Sic habent codd. plures et meliores et edd. antiquae, quod a novissi-
mis editoribus, ab Ernesfio, cui quod spurium videbatur, a Schiitzio, qui
-quum . . . soleant reposuit, et ab Orellio, qui itaque ceteri praetulit, non
debebat turbari. Illi enim omnes non attenderunt ad eum usum con-
iunctionis quod, quo ad exponendam diversarum inter se partium opposi-
tionem adhibetur; maxime ubi ex numero aliquo ceteri opponuntur uni
