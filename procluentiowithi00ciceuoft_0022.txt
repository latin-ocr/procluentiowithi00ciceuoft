own daughter, in the matter of A. Aurius Melinus. From
that time forward she regarded her son Cluentius with settled
hatred, and all his subsequent troubles, nrisfortunes, and
dangers in life are ascribed by Cicero to her profligate
schemes and untiring malignity (6, 61, 63, 64, 66, to the
end). W'e find a powerful summary of her crimes in Chap-
ters 66, 70. ln the latter she is designated as ‘Uxor generi,
noverca filii, filiae pellex!

ι. ΒΙΝΑΕΑ, a lady of Larinum. We gather from the con· ’
text that she had been twice married and had borne two
children by each marriage, two sons AURII (see below, κ, λ),
a son MAGIUS (μ), and a daughter MAGIA (ν), one of the
wives of the elder Oppianicus. She survived three of these

λ. NUMERIUS AURIUS, son of Dinaea (ι). He died first
of her family, making his half-brother Num. Magius (μ) his
heir. (7.)

μ. NUM. MAGIUS, son of Dinaea (ι). He died third of the
