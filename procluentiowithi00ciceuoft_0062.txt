plural in ‘ium,’ of certain datives and ablatives in ‘iis,’ of
preterites such as ‘amavistis,’ ‘audivistis,’ and the like, are
constantly interchanged according to the caprice or con-
venience of transcribers. MSS. vary much in representing
such words as ‘ animadvertere‚’ ‘magnopere‚’ and the like, as
compound or split up into their elements, and in the selection
of a particular form, where two or more are in common use,
as in ‘inermis’ and ‘inermus‚’ ‘hilaris’ and ‘hilarus‚' ‘ut'
and ‘uti‚’ ‘sicut’ and ‘sicuti‚’ ‘ni' and ‘nisi‚’ and the like.
