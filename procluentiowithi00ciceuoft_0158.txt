against his client which the accuser endeavoured to turn to the best V,
account, and the ‘crimina’ or direct charges unde} which he was

lmgessilifflerfugere . . . reticendo. The young scholar win observe ’

that while ⁴ tacere ’ signifies simply ‘to be silent ’ without implying that ὲ
there is anything to be told, ‘ reticere‚’ on the other hand, indicates that ⁴
there is something which might be told but which is wilfully ‘kept

back! In Chap. 6, ξ 1 7, ‘reticere’ is used transitively-—‘ reticere parentum
iniurias.⁷

1 1. Altera pars, ea quae propria est, διε, So Lambinus and most 1

edd. of note. The MSS. vary considerably‚ but the matter is of trifling·
importance. A, Β, and several others have ‘pars est ea;' C, ‘pars ³ ⁴
et ea? which is adopted by Classem but the ‘et’ would have an ’
awkward and embarrassing effect when followed by the ‘et’ before ,

‘legitimam’ other MSS. have simply ‘altera pars quae‚’ which is
perhaps the true reading, ‘ ea.’ ‘ et ea‚' and ‘est ea ’ being glosses.

13. Per mihi brevis. We find elsewhere in Cicero examples of ;·

this separation of a preposition from the word with which it is com-

pounded, an arrangement to which the term Tmesis has been applied ³
by grammarians. Thus—-‘ per mihi, per, inquam, gratum feceris'— “

‘per enim magni aestimatio,' &c.
15. Gonoionibus seditiose concitatis. Cicero here alludes to the

turbulent public meetings which were factiously harangued by the
Tribune Quintius, and which are more particularly described below, ’

except A, B, C, which omit ‘tanta‚’ and are followed by Class. But ¹

‘tanta' ought to be retained both with reference to the ‘quantum'
which precedes, and to the ‘ tamen’ which follows.

Illa. me res tamen, &c. Cicero here means—I am comforted .
in my embarrassment, great as it is, by the reflection that you, being ·,

experienced jurors, are well accustomed to deal fairly with direct
charges (crimina). On the one hand, you do not believe such a charge
as soon as it is stated by the accuser, but wait until you see whether
the advocate on the other side can disprove it—on the other hand, you

show no bias in favour of the accused, and give no credit to the

assertions made on his behalf unless they are substantiated by arguments

and evidence. So far, therefore, as the direct charges (crimina) against “ ’
my client are concerned‚ I rely fully on your uprightness and im-

partiality. But it is the prejudice (invidia) prevailing against Cluentius
which alarms me, and I must implore you to dismiss this from your
minds both for his sake and for the sake of the common safety of au.
