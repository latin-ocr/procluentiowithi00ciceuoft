3. Animi et virtutis. Here‘ animus' is equivalent to‘ spirit!
7.1neptiis ac fabulis, So all MSS„ except A, B, which have
‘ineptis fabulisss and so Class'. and Bait.
11. Poenis. The F unes—the avengers of guilt (see Varr. ap. Nom*v

c. 4, n. 418). Valerius Flaccus (1. 796) calls‘ Poena’ the mother of·
the Furies. Cicero (In Pison. 37, ξ 91) apostrophizes Piso as—‘ 02
Poena, Ο Furia sociorum. ⁹ Observe, however, the difference of meaning?
in the two passages here‘ Poenae uxorum ’— ‘fratris' — ‘liberum’ are
the Furies who avenge the wrongs done by Oppianicus to his wives- his ⁴7
brother, and his children; but‘ Poena sociorum' is, ‘the tormentor οἱ
our allies.’ ²
¹ Liberum ⁹ is a not very common syncope for ¹ liberorum!
12. Quae si falsa sunt, id. quod omnes intellig-unt. Cicero, ass

a rhetoxiciam finds it convenient elsewhere to take a different view of
the popular belief with regard to a future state—thus, in his last ’
oration (Philipp. 14. 12), when speaking of those who had fallen at the 1⁵
battle of Modena— s
‘Illi igitur impii (the soldiers of Antonyl quos cecidistis, etiam ad J
inferos poenas parricidii luent: vos vero (the soldiers of the Consuls) ,-
qui extremum spiritum in victoria effudistis, piorum estis sedem et locum ⁷
consecuti! ’
20. Cur deinde tu. So all MSS. and edd., except A, B. Class„ and j
Bait„ who have ‘ Cur igitur tu.' a
26. Latius potuit. So all the MSS„ but Orelli, following Lambinus '-
and several of the early edd., substitutes ‘latentius,’ which is at oncev t '
unnecessary and inappropriate. The meaning of ‘latius' is clear. '3
‘Could the poison spread its influence more widely if hidden in· some
one morsel of bread‚’ in which case it might not have been swallowed ³
at all by the intended victim, ‘than if the whole had been dissolved ,
and diffused in a draught of wine,’ presented to him? The sequence is. ’ ,
¹ saeilius,‘ ⁴ more easily administered ;' ‘latius‚' ‘ more widely diffused in ,⁴
the vehicle in which it was administered ;’ ‘celerius,’ ‘more speedy in ζ,
its effect? Moreover, ‘ facilius fallere’ would be a mere repetition if Ι
⁶ latentius ' were the true reading. - Δ ⁷*
30. Si esset animadversum. Strictly, ⁴ animadversum' must agree -j
with ‘venenum‚' but the meaning is—‘if the attempt to administer-
poison had been discovered,' was the poison itself more likely to escapessn
notice if concealed in a piece of bread‚ in which oese it would have]
preserved its own form distinct, and could have been separated from ⁸
the vehiele, than if mixed with wine, in which case it would have been ”
so combined with the vehicle that it would have been impossible to» 3⁴

separate it ἲ
