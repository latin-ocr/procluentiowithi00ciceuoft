ventum quendam popularem esse quaesitum;’ where‘ ventus popularis
means ‘the applause of the crowd:¹ and again, in the same chapter-4 Ἴ
ξ 131 ‘Ex ista subscriptione rumorem quendam et plausum populi esse}
quaesitum! The idea pervading these expressions being‘ ςοωεῖιι“
devoid of substance and stability.’ ¹
1 1. Eius ordinis iudicia, ι. e. the privilege os acting as jurors which =
belonged to that body. ι
28. Ut res patefacta. The detection of Staienus is mentioned in
the Topica, 20, ξ 75

31. Huius Staieni persona. An animated discussion, in which many
of the most celebrated grammarians of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and ,
seventeenth centuries—Valla‚ Sanctius, Vossius, Scioppius, Perizonius, , J
and others—took part, was long maintained upon the question whether 3 3
the Latin word ‘Persona’ was ever used by the writers of the golden ¹ χ
age to denote‘ an individual man? in the same sense as‘ person‘ is used
in English, and‘ Person' in German. Milton, in the preface to his ,
‘Defensio pro Populo Anglicanoss vehemently assails Salmasius f& ι.
having, in his‘ Defensio Regia: characterized the execution of Charles ,⁷
the First as ‘parricidium m ransom REGIS admissum‚’ an expression 3
which he denounces as a ‘multiplex barbarismus,’ and declares that .
Salmasius deserved to be hooted and flogged for his bad Latinity. γ
The expression at the beginning of this chapter has been appealed to ’-
as a proof that the phrase is unexceptionable, but it must be observed
that we are by no means called upon to translate ⁶ Staieni persona* by j
‘the person of Staienusx but rather the character of Staienus—the part ς
which he had played on the stage of public life’ —a meaning of ·
‘persona 'which is beyond controversy, and the same explanation may '·
be given of all the other passages in Cicero which have been referred to ,
in the dispute. On the whole, Milton seems to be right' m so far as the ,
purest writers of Latinity are concerned‚ but the rule does not apply to ·
the period of the decline. The whole question is fully treated in »’
Guntherus, ‘Latinitas Restituta,' p. 405. Iena. 1717. .
P. 92. l. 15. Summa. potestate praeditus. This is no exaggeration. · ’
The civil power of a Tribunus Plebis was in reality superior to that of π
any other magistrate. Again in 34, ξ 94, he terms the power of α’ ,
Tribunos—⁴ summa vis potestatis! ·
