‘Lex Sempronia' appears to have continued in force until
superseded by the ‘ Lex Cornelia?

SECT. 8.--On the particular Chapters of the ‘Lex Cornelia '
which applied to the case qs Cluentius.

It appears that Cluentius was charged with having caused
poison to be administered to three different persons (eo—62),
and this offence would fall under the F ifth Chapter of the
Cornelian Law. It is perfectly clear, however, that little

may attach to the ex parte statement of a forensic pleader‚
it is not credible that Cicero would have ventured to pass
over the charges so lightly and almost contemptuously had
they not been in reality frivolous. Out of the seventy-one
Chapters into which the speech is divided, three only (eo-62)
are devoted to the exposition and refutation of these alleged
mmders, and the evidence by which they are rebutted iS‚ if
fairly stated, quite irresistible. There can be little doubt
that they were employed by the prosecutor merely as a
pretext for bringing Cluentius before a Roman jury, and that
he counted upon obtaining a conviction by rekindling the
flame of odium which had blazed forth so fiercely against all
who had been mixed up with the ‘Iudicium Iunianum.’

in his opening speech, was to refresh the memory of those
whom he was addressing, to recall to their recollection all
the proceedings connected with the trial of Oppianicus, to
remind thcm of the indignation‚ deep and loud, which had
prevailed among all classes on account of what was believed
to be the condemnation of an innocent man, procured by
the most infamous corruption—of the eagerness with which
the people had availed themselves of the first opportunity of
