proved to have gone about armed with the intent to commit
robbery or murder—‘ qui cum telo ambulaverit hominis
necandi furtive faciendi causa.’

The F ifth Chapter treated of Poisoning‚ and the penalties
extended to every one who could be proved to have com-
pounded‚ sold, bought, kept in his possession, or administered
poison with intent of causing death—‘ qui fecerit, vendiderit,
emerit, habuerit, dederit.’

Other Chapters treated of Arson, and probably of Parricide.

But in addition to these there was a Chapter which treated

or have combined or conspired in any way to procure the
conviction of an innocent man when criminally impeached‚
or, if acting in the capacity of a judge or juror, have received
money for that purpose.

There was a remarkable speciality in this Chapter; for
while in the Chapters on Assassination, Poisoning‚ &c., the
penalties of the law were denounced against all who might
be proved guilty, without distinction of rank or station, men
and women, bond and free, the penalties for what we have
termed Judicial Murder were restricted to those who had a
seat in the Senate—the order from which, according to the
ordinances of Sulla, the jurors in criminal trials were selected
exclusively.

Moreover, while, as we have mentioned above, there had
been no legislation with regard to murder since the Code of
the XII Tables: both C. Gracchus and M. Livius Drusus had
enacted laws for the suppression of judicial corruption—the
‘Lex Sempronia ’——‘ NE oms IUDICIO CIRCUMVENIRETUR¹;’
and the ‘ Lex Livia ’—‘ SI QU1s OB REM IUDICATAM PECUNIAM
CEPISSET ².’ The ‘Lex Livia’ had been repealed, but the
