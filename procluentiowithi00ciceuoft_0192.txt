32. ma. iudicia. senatoria, i. e. ‘those trials when the juries w '
composed of senators exclusivelyff ,
1². 84. l. 1. Vera atque insigni turpitudine, &a See especial ' ’ξ
ln Verr.Act.1. 13. . ἶ
21. ¹1¹. Atti. We find here and elsewhere (31, ξ 84; 57, ξ 120) t. ’ᾗ
MSS vary between the forms Accius and Attius, and the same confusio
takes place with regard to the tragic poet. ι,
Cicero in the Brutus (78, 5 271) thus expresses his opinion of this
speaker. - ’ ,
‘Itaque ne hos quidem equites Romanos amicos nostros, qui nu· τ J ’
mortui sunt, P. Cominium Spoletinum, quo accusante defendi C. Corne· ³
1ium,in quo et compositum dicendi genus et acre et expeditum fuit:
T. Attium Pisaurensem, cuius accusationi respondi pro A. Cluentio, qm 1
et accurate dicebat et satis copiose, eratque praeterea doctus Herma-
gorae praeceptis, quibus etsi ornamenta non satis opima dicendi, tamen, J
ut hastae velitibus amentatae, sic apta quaedam et parata singuliq-
causarum generibus argumenta traduntur,’ διο. ³
No fragment of his orations has been anywhere preserved. j
29. Per' Fabricios. So all MSS. except A, B, which have
‘Fabricium’ and so Class. But see 22, ς 59, and a few lines only}
above we have ‘ Fabricios? .
30. Exstat memoria, i.e. ‘ the recollection of individuals’ as distin-²*
guished from ‘ tabulae publicae ' in the next clause. In a great number³
of MSS. we find ‘exstant memoriae‚' but Classen has pointed out that-
the use of the word ‘memoriae’ in the sense of ‘commentarii’ or ·,
‘memoirs’ belongs to a later age. It seems to be first employed in ἐ
this sense in Aulus Gellius—e. g. N. A. 4. 6 ‘In veteribus memoriis =''
scriptum est3' 10. 12 ‘Phavorinus philosophus memoriarum veterum ³*
exequentissimus.’ We find ⁵ vitae memoriam‚' ‘ a memoir of the lise: in {s
Suet. Claud. 1. , I.
31. Sunt tabulae publicae. It is evident from this passage, andtj
from 36, ᾗ 99, that a record of the whole proceedings in criminal trial. j
was carefully preserved, for we fmd Cicero appealing to the depositionis ,-
of witnesses taken several years before as doeuments readily αοοεςείδῑε.,ῗ
1². 85.1. 2. In maledieti 1000. A, B, have ‘locum,' but Classen
rightly retains the common reading, and has collected examples of this-
use of‘ loco.⁹ ε
16. Alia. ratione. So A, Β, D, and all MSS.. with very sev*
exceptions, but the great majority of edd. have, perversely enough,
adopted‘ aliqua ratione.' Cicero certainly did not mean to say that:
Oppianicus was in some respects doubtful as to the issue of the trial, ,,
a feeling which might have been entertained by one absolutely inuocem. ’ ⁷
