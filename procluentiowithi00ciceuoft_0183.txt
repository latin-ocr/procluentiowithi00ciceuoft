are not represented as having been accomplices.

23. In discordiis civitatis. The civil strife of Marius, Sulla,
Cinna, Carbo, Lepidus, Catulus, &c., from 88 axx—78 Rc.

29. In quo, inter allegatos. The reading and interpretation of
this passage have given rise to much discussion. A, Β, have ‘in quo
alligaturus but the great majority of MSS. have ‘in quo inter allegatos,'
sor which some substitute ⁶ alligatos!

(1) Tumebus (Advers. 5. 23) adopts ⁴ alligatos,' and explains the word
to mean ‘culpae affines? i. e. ‘The name of Oppianicus stood first

ζ amongst those implicated in the crime according to the information of

, Avillius.¹ That ‘alligatos’ will bear this meaning is proved by re·
ἢ ferring to Cic. Epp, ad Q. F. 2. 3, Pro Cluent. 54, ξ 148, Pro Rabir.
⁵ Post. 6, §143 7, ξ 13.

(2) J. F. Gronovius (ad Liv. 37. 11) adopts ‘allegatos,' connecting it
with ‘constabat,‘ and supposes the ‘allegati' to be the commissioners
employed to take the evidence of Avillius. ‘The commissioners were
agreed upon this point (viz.), that the name of Oppianicus stood fore-
most in the depositions of Avillius?

(3) Orelli connects ‘inter allegatos ' with ‘ primum Oppianici nomen‚'
and understands the ‘ allegati ' to be persons provided by Oppianicus to
assist in contriving and executing the murder of Avillius—an explana-
tion approaching closely to that of Turnebus. .

(4) Classen adopts the reading of A, B, ‘in quo alligatum Oppianici
nomen primum esse constabat,’ and explains ‘alligatum' to signisy
⁸ testimonio obstrictum et convictum.’ He is followed by Baiter.

(5) By the wn‘ters of the first and second centuries ‘allegare' is
frequently used in the sense of ⁸ to bring sorward in the way of proof or
defence ⁸—thus‚ ⁰ allegare exempla ς’ ‘ allegare decreta ; ’ ‘in deprecanda
poena allegare aliquid: &c. Is we could adopt this meaning, ‘inter
allegatos’ might be fairly interpreted ‘the name of Oppianicus stood
first among those mentioned by Avillius in confirmation of his story.'
It does not appear, however, that there is any other example of ‘ allegare’
in this sense among the writers contemporary with or more ancient
than Cicero.

P. 75. l. 4. Per quem interfecerat plurimos. These words,
although very suspicions, seem to be found in all MSS. They are
bracketed by Baiter.

7. Pharmaoopolam circumforaneum, i. e. ‘an itinerating quack.'
Thtre can be no doubt as to the reading, although A, B, have · foranum'
and most other MSS. ¹ circumforanum.’

9. Duobun nimbus 118. This is the reading which we extract
