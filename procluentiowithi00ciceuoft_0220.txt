6. P. Septimio scaevolae. This person was a Roman Senator
one os the Jurors on the trial of Oppianicus. He was impeached d ' 3
the Praetorship of Q Hortensius (72 B. c.) on a charge‘ De Repetundis, ²
and found guilty. But although this charge had no connection wi ι’
his conduct on the trial of Oppianicus (so Cicero says distinctly at th
end of the chapter—‘ aliis criminibus· ), but seems to have been th
result of some malversation on the part of the accused in Apulia, th
jurors, in their ‘Litis Aestimati0,’ took into account the circumstanm
that he had received a bribe upon the trial of Oppianicus (profertur . ., ,,
litem eo nomine esse estimatam). This is distinctly stated by Ci · ι.
himself, In Verr. Act. 1. 13 .

‘Cognoscet ex me Populus Romanus . . . quid sit, quod, P. Septimi ’

aestimata sit eo nomine quod ille ob rem iudicandam pecun' ..4⁴7
accepisset! ¹
12. Inimicum putant esse. Two reasons are here assigned whi ’ ι ,
tended to render jurors lenient or careless in the ‘ Litis Aestimatio.’
i. They believe that the person they have found guilty will look u· · ,
them as his personal enemies and therefore they desire to prove tha ,Ῑ
they are willing to befiiend him as far as they can, ‘si qua in eum 1· 1·
capitis illata est, non admittunt! ’
ii. Thinking that their duty as jurors has been ρἰεὴειιὲεᾶ by bringing-s
in a verdiet, they are indifferent and careless about the subsequent pro- ⁴
ceeding, ‘negligentius attendunt cetera.¹ ’
15. Itaque et maiestatis. This is the most desperate sentence ἱιιἸ
the whole passage. We have given the text of Orelli, which is suppor- ςΙ
ted by all MSS. except A, Β, but 1 am unable, without great violence„l
to twist any satisfactory meaning out os the words. ἐ.
A, B, insert ‘maiestatis' before ‘fessent and the text stands thus ms
the edd. of Class. and Bait. - ¹
‘Itaque et maiestatis absoluti sunt permulti, quibus damnatis d
pecuniis repetundis lites maiestatis essent aestimatae: from which the-
following meaning is extracted :—Very many persons having been found-A
guilty when impeached ‘ De Repetundis, ’ the jurors in the ⁶ Litis Aesti4
matio’ having implied that they were guilty of‘ Maiestas? have, awhffl'
brought to trial for‘ Maiestas? been acquitted. ⁷
There can be no doubt that this' is a distinct meaning, but Ι hesitaoe·
to adopt it, because it appears to me to be completely at variance wi ιἊ
the tenor of Cicero’ s observations. The orator, in the preceding>
sentence, if Ι understand it might, has asserted that the jurors were for .:·‘
