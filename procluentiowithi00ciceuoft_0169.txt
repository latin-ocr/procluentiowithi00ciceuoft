MSS. and edd. omit ‘iam‚’ and so Classen and Baiter. But ‘iam,'
which is found in D, E, and many good MSS„ may be fairly defended
ts qualisying ‘ commune dedecus.’—The disgrace which was no longer
confined to Sassia individually‚ but now extended to the whole family,
now that she had been guilty of this outrage. ‘Iam' was little likely
to have been interpolated, but might have been readily omitted in
consequence of not being understood. Classen supposes it to have
grown out os the ‘ fam ' at the beginning of the next word.

¹4. Quam ut. illa matre. A, Β, omit ‘matre,' and so Classen and
Baiter, but all other MSS. have ‘ matre,' and n'ghtlyz for the word is
here emphatic. Cluentius resolved to take no step more violent than
simply refraining from holding intercourse with ‘that woman as a
mother.'

Ne quam. Classen here introdrcez, on conjecture, ‘nam quae,'
which approaches closely to ‘ namque, the reading in A, B. All other
MSS. have ¹ ne quam,' to which, notwithstanding all that has been said
by Classen, there is no substantial objection. At all events ‘ ne’ seems
to be absolutely required, and is ⁴ ne quam ’ is offensive, we may admit
'ne quae,' the conjecture of Garatoni, which has been adopted by Baiter.
Observe, also, that although A, B, have ‘ namque‚' B has ‘ne, ea si
matre uteretur‚’ thus introducing ‘ ne‚’ although not in the right place.

²4· Atoue in ipsa natura. A, B, omit ‘in,' and so Classen, who
remarks—‘im quod vulgo ante ipsa inseritur. non agnoscunt prae-
stantissimi libri: recte: nam sic facilius genitivus hominum etiam ad
noueram refertur, quod ratio postulate-d take the very opposite view.
Is we retain ‘in’ the construction is clearly—⁴ Quod positum atque
infixum est in communibus hominum sensibus atque in ipsa natura
hominum '-but is we omit ‘in’ the connection of ‘natura' with ‘ho-
minum’ is no longer necessary, and we might regard ‘natura’ as the
instrument—⁸ this sentiment which has been riveted in the feelings of
all men alike and riveted by nature.'

25. Qui ad hominum pericula defendenda adiungerer. So
A. B, Classen, and Baiter. The MSS. vary much) in details, but
most edd. have ‘quum ad amici pericula depellenda adhiberer3’ but
‘amici' is out of place, sor—1. Cicero nowhere speaks of Cluentius

as his friend. 2. The fact that he was endeavouring to protect a friend
” is the very circumstance which would have justified him in being more
nevere upon Sassia.-Hoc dixit orator, ‘Quam legem humanae naturae
insitam ornnes cognitam habent, earn ego non noverim, quem ipsum
vitae institutum. quem proprium causarum dicendarum studium ad

ιὲιιωηῑες hominum sensus et affectus penitus perspiciendos vomit?—
