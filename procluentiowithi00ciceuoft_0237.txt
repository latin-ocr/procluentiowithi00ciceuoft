allow his audience to suppose that he acquiesced in the doctrine
broaehed by Attius, and that he seels himself bound to refute his argu-
·’ JmentS. With this refutation he is occupied' 111 the five chapters which
follow, but before commencing, he again warns the jury that he does
’, not mean to insist upon this plea on behalf of his client :—

f ι ‘Wheresore‚ Cluentius, Ι comply with your wishes in so far as you
ἵ yourself are coneerned; I do not read over the law, although this alone
would suffice sor your acquittal, nor in this place (i. e. in the portion of
”the speech which immediately follows) do Ι plead for you, but I will
’ υ not leave out (Ι will not refrain from stating) those things which I think
, are expected and wished for from me (by my audience).’ It is clear
’ , that ⁶ te' cannot refer to Cluentius, for Cicero is here impressing upon
v those he addresses that it was the wish of Cluentius that he should
“ pass over this plea—‘te’ cannot refer to Attius, for it would be
v absurd to say that Attius was longing for the refutation of his own
” arguments.

8. Ut id iniquissimum esse confitear. Here ‘ut confitear'
, signifies ‘ supposing that Ι were to admit.’

9. Eis...iis. ‘Eis' is here equivalent to ‘talibus.' In the next
clause A, B, instead of ·iis’ have ‘hist which is, perhaps, more
distinet.

10. Deinde quis umquam hoo senator accusavit. . .ut‚i non
s oportere. All recent edd„ with the exception of Class. and Bait„
’ adopt this reading, but it is doubtful whether ‘non' is to be found in
; any MS„ and it certainly ought to be omitted. The meaning clearly
⁴ is—‘ What senator, aster having attained by the favour of the Roman
‘g people to a more elevated position in the social scale (than his sellow-
“· countrymen), ever complained of this, (viz.)‚ that, in consequence (of his
., elevation)‚ he must submit to more severe legal restraints (than those
v. below him in rank).'

, The use of ‘ accusavit' for ⁴ conquestus est' is singular, and the whole
ζ combination is so harsh that, in all probability, some corruption lurks
. -. in the text.

16. amplitudinis commodo. Almost all edd. have ‘commodis‚'
which is found in one MS. only.

18. Easdem vitae conditiones. ‘Vitae conditiones' are the
liabilities and responsibilities attached to particular stations in life, the
· *f tex-ms, as it were, on which we occupy a certain station in lise. See
„ γ again in 56, ς ¹54 ‘ea conditione proposita,' and 5 155 ‘Quae si vobis
,ἦ oonditio placet?

is 21. Qui nummum locum . . . adscendere. so A, B, and many
of the best MSS. Most edd. have ‘in summum locum? For the
