156 CICERO PR'o OLUENTIO. cm 5, n.- 5

‘Apud antiquos non solum publice sed etiam privatim nihil gerebatur
nisi auspicio prius sumpto. Quo ex more nuptiis etiam nunc' auspices
interponuntur, qui, quamvis auspicia petere desierint, ipso tamen nomine
veteris consuetudinis vestigia usurpant.’

In the time of Plautus the omens were probably actually observed on
such occasions—in the Prologue to the Casina (85) we read-

‘Argentum si quis dederit, ut ego suspicor:
Ult10 ibit nuptum, non manebit auspices?

Juvenal, when describing the preparations made by Messalina for her
formal nuptials with Silius——

ddudum sedet illa parato
F lammeolo, Tyriusque palam genialis in hortis
Sternitur, et ritu decies centena dabuntur
Antiquo, veniet cum signatoribus auspex,’

with which compare Sueton. Claud. 26.

31. Nullis auctoribus. According to Roman law a woman was
never regarded as completely ⁶ sui iuris.' She was always ‘ In Potestate
parentis‚’ or ‘In Manu viri,' or ‘In tutela! Hence, strictly speaking,
she could perform no legal act without the sanction of her father.
or of her husband, or of her guardian, as the case might be, and the
person or persons who gave this sanction became ‘Auctor’ or ‘Aue-
tores' of the transaction. Thus in the speech on the Lex Oppia,
ascribed by Livy (34, 2,) to Cato —‘ Maiores nostri, nullam, ne privatam
quidem, rem agere feminas sine auctore voluerunt: in manu esse
parentum, fratrum, virorum.’—Here ‘nullis auctoribus’ implies that
this marriage was not countenanced or graced by the presence of any
of the relatives or friends of Sassia.

⁶ Auctor’ is used below (24, ξ 66) in the general sense of ⁴ supported
‘defender‚’ unless ‘fautore’ is the true reading. See note on the
passage in question.

P. 65, 1. 3. Nonne timuisse. A, B, some other MSS„ and Class..
have ‘nonne timuisti! If this be the true reading, Cicero ceases for
a moment to address the jury and apostrophizes Sassia as if she were
actually present. Many MSS„ however, and edd. have ⁴ nonne timuisse,’
and the best MSS. of Quintilian (Ι. O. 4, ξ 105) have either ‘non
timuisse' or ‘nonne timuisse. This is probably right, sor‘ nonne
timuisse' was more likely to have been changed into‘ nonne timuisti’
than vice versa. ——Baiter has‘ nonne timuisse)

9.'1¹u11t hoc commune dedecus iam familiae. A, B, and several

¹ Valerius Maximus probably flourished under the Emperor Tiberius.
