under its best form in the edition of Orelli, published at
Zurich in 1826.

The last-named editor possessed an advantage not enjoyed
by any of his predecessors; for, a few years before he brought
his labours to a close, Peyron, Professor of Oriental Languages
at Turin, observed that a MS. in the Royal Library, which
had formed part of the celebrated collection in the Monastery
of St. Columbanus at Bobbio, and which exhibited a work of
St. Augustin, was a Palimpsest. By means of an ingenious
chemical process the faint traces of the original writing were,
to a certain extent, revived, and, by dint of long continued
patient labour, at length fully deciphered. The volume,
consisting of fifty-six leaves of parchment, had evidently been
made up from a copy of the works of Cicero, and was found
to contain fragments of ten orations and of the ‘ Epistolae ad
F amiliares.’ Twelve of these leaves contained portions of
the Pro Cluentio; and although we hesitate to ascribe the
writing to a period so early as the second or third century,
it is, in all probability, not later than the fifth or sixth‚ and
is unquestionably‚ as far as it goes, the most ancient authority
we possess for this oration, and as such deserving of all
consideration.

Two or three years after the publication of Orelli’s work,
the attention of Classen, who was preparing a new edition
of this speech, was called by Niebuhr to the superior
character of a MS. at F lorence, in the Laurentian Library.
The excellence of this copy having been fully established,
led to further search, and a second MS. was found in the
Royal Library at Munich, which had been brought from
Salzburg, bearing a close resemblance to the former. After
. a earesul examination of these two, Classen arrived at the
conclusion, that although neither could be regarded as a
transcript of the other, both might be traced to a common
archetype very superior to the sources from which the great
mass of MSS. on which the ordinary text was founded had
been derived; and that although these MSS. had not escaped
