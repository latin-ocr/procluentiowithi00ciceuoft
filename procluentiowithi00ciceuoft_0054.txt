42 INTRODUC'TION.

Faesulanos apud Bandinium n. 187, Lagom. 1, membranaceus
sec. decimi quinti: lacunarum immunis!

Ε. ‘ Laurentianus plut. LI, n. 10, Lagom. 64, membranaceus
sec. undecimi, characteribus Langobardicis, form. 4. Praeter
M. Terentii Varronis libros de lingua Latina Ciceronis ora-
tionem Cluentianam et Rhetorica ad Herennium continet.
Hic liber omnium, quibus usi sumus, antiquissimus, haud
dubie pro fonte habendus eorum, qui sequuntur, et omnium
fortasse, in quibus eaedem lacunae apparent.’

It will be observed that, in the last sentence, reference is
made to certain blanks. These are found in a considerable
number of the MSS. of this speech; and it is reasonable to
believe that the MSS. in which they exactly correspond were

all derived, originally, from the same archetype. Those which
occur in E are the following 1-

1. 36, § 102. From ‘in tota causa' down to 38, § 107—
‘ non quaerunt!

2. 45, § 127. From ‘subscripserunt ’ down to 47, ξ 132—
‘ opinione standum.'

3. 54, § 149. From ‘dicenda est’ down to 56, § 154-
‘ quae tunc!

4. 63, § 176. From ‘quendam' down to 65, § 182—‘ et

ceterorum honestissimorum!

It may be remarked that the blanks (3) and (4) occur in a
greater number of MSS. than (1) and (2), and that in several
MSS. where all or some of these blanks originally occurred,
the defect has been supplied by a second hand.

In the notes we shall refer to the above MSS„ severally‚ by
the letters A, B, C, D, E3 and, for the sake of convenience,
we shall here mention the marks by which the same MSS. are
designated in the editions of Classen and Baiter :—
