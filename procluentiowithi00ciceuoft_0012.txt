viii PREFA GE To THE' FIRQT EDJTJON.

although the two MSS. which he chiefly followed are
unquestionably of great value‚ he has formed a somewhat
exaggerated estimate of their importance, and having re-
solved to adhere to them wherever it was practicable, he
became, as it were, an ex parte advocate, his ingenuity
enabling him to urge most plausible reasons for change
in many cases where the change was the reverse of an im-
provement. His arguments, when read for the first time,
are so dazzling that we are inclined to follow blindly
wherever he leads3 but on a second perusal, when the
brilliancy is somewhat dispelled, doubts arise as to the path
we are pumuing, and eventually we arx-ive at the conclusion
that we have not seldom been led astray.

One word with regard to the Commentary itself.

I have endeavoured to the best of my ability to explain
everything which might fairly cause embarrassment to a
young scholar; but at the same time 1 have not felt called
upon to enter into any lengthened details upon those points
of History and Antiquities of which a knowledge may be
readily obtained from the Dictionaries and Manuals, which
are, or ought to be, in the hands of every one. It is intended
for the use of my students, and I have striven to adapt it
especially to their wants. I shall be very proud if it should
prove serviceable to more advanced scholars3 but my prin-
cipal object has been to consult the interests of those whom
Ι am chiefly bound to serve.
