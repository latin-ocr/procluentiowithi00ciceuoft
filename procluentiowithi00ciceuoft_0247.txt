γ’ §5 17¹—1 76. NOTES. 23 5

Ρ. 133. 1. 1. Propter multorum eiusmodi mortem, satis firmam
, . . . non haberet.. A, Β, have ‘propter multorum eiusmodi casum,
j minime firmam veneni suspicionem haberet? a reading which is, perhaps,
Ι ns good as the vulgate, but 1 am unable to see that it possesses the

¹ ’ great superiority so much vaunted by Classen over the received text.
’ - Isthere is some awkwardness in the phrase—‘propter multorum eius-
“’ modi mortem ¹—which must mean, ‘in consequence of a death of that

⁴· kind (i. e. sudden death) falling upon many persons (i. e. being a common
” occurrence),’ the difficulty is in no way diminished by the substitution

τ of ‘casum' for ‘mortemss Whichever of these two is the true reading,

¹⁷ the other was probably placed as a marginal gloss by some tran-
schldenlie MSS. omit ‘non‚’ and hence the substitution of ‘minime’ sor
· salglasitei· l'dlllgws A, B, and Classen.

‚ 12. Sex. Attio. The MSS, as usual in such cases, vary as to this
¹ ”²1:13- Vir dissolutissimus. A ‘vir dissolutus· is properly one who
= has shaken himself loose from all the ties of social morality. Cicero
„s frequently uses the phrase.

,ἶ 14. Incolumi fortuna, i. e. ‘while enjoying prosperity, suffering
= under no missortune.’ The ‘fortuna’ of Oppianicus, after his ‘dam-

⁴ natio: was no longer ⁸ incolumis ¹ but ⁶ fracta: See note on 4, 5 10.

2 20. Ad urbem . . . extra poi-tam. It would appear from this that
- Oppianicus, although ‘ damnatus et exsul‚' was at liberty to live in the

⁷ vicinity of Rome, although he could not enter the city.

27. Post mortem eius Sassia.. So all MSS. and edd„ but Baiter,

following Beck, brackets the word ‘ Sassia!

31. In emendo Diogene. See 16, ξ 47. Sassia bought Strato

, from Rupilius, who was a stranger. but she demanded the slave of her
-ξ sou sor the torture (in quaestionem postulavit).

32. De Asela quodam. The best MSS. have ¹ Asela' or ‘Asela‚'
and there can be little doubt that some proper name lurks here. Many

v MSS. and almost all edd. have ‘de assecla‚' which, although specious
“js-T nt first sight, is in reality not intelligible.

1³. 134. 1. 10. vehementissimis. So all MSS. and edd. except A,

‘³ B, class.. and Bait.. who have ⁸ vehementissime?

12. Auctoritate advocatorum et vi tormentorum adducti.
There are no important variations in the MSS.. but the difficulty of

,ἷν Ῠ the passage is obvious. Classen endeavours to remove this by supposing
’ , that Cicero is speaking ironically. ‘Nihil in his novandum est: sed
, cum ironia ista proferuntur: nam si quid miseros illos ad confitenda
