s* Β, have· Stratonem. ,δίκεεςεῖ Althongh the form of the proposi-

„ tion is different, the general sense and. force of the passage remain

mehanged.

3 13. 'fabellae quaestionis, i. e. minutes of the evidence given under

ν torture, noted down and attested (obsignatas) at the time (tum) by

⁷ the signature of the‘ advocati!

> 16. Primum. So A, B. ‘ Primum' corresponds with ‘’post in the

-;·next clanse.‘ primam,’ which is the reading of most MSS. and edd„

’ is quite out os place.

21. Indiam-at. So A, B, and the great majority of MSS. A few

, MSS. and all edd. before Classen have ⁸ indicarat.’

, P. 138. 1. 2. Quis obsignarit. So nearly all MSS. Most edd. have
, ‘quis obsignavit?

⁷ 3. Neminem reperietis, &c. The meaning is—You will be unable

ᾗ to find any one to bear witness to the authenticity of these depositions,

, except it be a person of „such infamous character that I should be glad

. to see him produced. because the testimony of such a man would injure

your cause. Cicero, very probably, intends to indicate the paramour
of Sassia.

’ 7. Afferes. So most edd.. but the great majority of MSS. have

.- ‘afferas' which may be admitted without scruple, for, as Classen re·

= marks—‘ inest admiratio quaedam in coniunctim?

. 10. Esto, i. e. ‘ Enough of this-let us pass on.' The conjectures of

' those critics who have proposed to substitute ‘ nonnihil ' or ¹ aliquid ’ for

. ‘nihil' in the following clause, are undeserving of attention. They seem

to have supposed that ‘esto' here signifies‚ as it certainly often' does,

= ‘granted that.’

, ao.. Nam Stratonem quidem. ‘Nam' indicates an aposiopesis—
’ ⁸1 ask this question with regard to Nicostratus, ron the fate of Strato is

’ notorious’

32. voluerit, optaverit, &c. Here we have a elimax—¹ Velle‚' ‘ to

ζ be willing‚’ expressing little more than the absence of disinclination.

’ ‘optares · to be actively and earnestly desirous.'.

⁸ Cogitare,' ‘to combine one’s thoughts for the attainment of an object?

‘Efficere,' ⁶ to carry out a purpose?

See above, note on 64, ς 178.

1³. 139. 1. 6. Obsides filios . . . mortuos. See 9, ς 27.

, ,, 'Pam denique in, &c. Observe the expression—⁶ nupsit in familiae

‘³³ , luctum atque in privignorum sunus'-where ‘in ‘ may be rendered by to

, = in the sense of—‘ so as to produce an immediate result.’

,Λ ‚ 8. Aurium. Most edd have Aurium Melinum! but every MS.

5⁷2⁴ >- uoept one omits· Melinum? A has‘ M. Mauriumss Bhas‘ A. Aurium?
