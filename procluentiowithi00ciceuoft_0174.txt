(3) In the latter part of this chapter Cicero expressly states that ξ
Oppianicus found means to make away, not only with that Aurius who „Q
had threatened to impeach him, but also with ⁴ alterum Aurium.’ But '3³
this ‘alter Aurius’ must be A. Aurius Melinus, whose murder is again
referred to in 8, ξ 26, no other Aurius having been mentioned except

the sons of Dinaea, both of whom were now dead.

(4) The circumstance that A. Aurius Melinus is styled ‘ adolescens· at

the time of his marriage with Cluentia, is in no way incompatible with

his being the father of a son, C. Aurius, who is here named as having -

been put to death. The age of this C. Aurius is not stated, and he may
have been a boy, the issue os the marriage of A. Aurius with Cluentia.
At all events, the great sacility and frequency of divorce, at this period.

Melinus may have been married before his union with Cluentia. It is
well known that the term ‘ adolescens ' is applied to persons upwards of

and did good service in the struggle which followed. This is the
period referred to in the text. Metellus was the colleague of Sulla in
the consulship (80 n.c.)‚ celebrated a triumph in 71 1³.c., along with
Pompey, in honour of the close of the warin Spain against Sertorius,
and subsequently became Pontifex Maximus. He was styled ⁶ Pius’ in
consequence of the devoted affection which he manifested towards his
father, when the latter was persecuted and driven into banishment by
Marius and Saturninus (100 13.c.). He is characterized by Cicero as·—
‘Metellus homo sanctissimus modestissimusque omnium ' (Pro Archia,
5, 5 )-

omitted in A, B, are retained by Classen, and bracketed by Baiter.

30. Quo sequestre. According to the testimony of grammarians and
jux-ists, which is sully borne out by quotations from the earliest writers,
the word ‘Sequester' was originally employed to denote a person in
whose hands disputed property was deposited, and who retained it in
trust until the pretensions of the different claimants were adjusted. The
