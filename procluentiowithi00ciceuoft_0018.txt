6 tNTROD chmN.

Eight years had now elapsed since the condemnation· of
Oppianicus, yet the circumstances of the case were by no
means forgotten. The odium against Cluentius seems to
have been revived by the present impeachment, and ad-
vantage of this prejudice was taken by the advocate for the
prosecution. Cicero was fully alive to the difficulty of his
position, and at the commencement of the oration we find
such phrases as the following repeated again and again—
‘ Invidia iam inveterata iudicii Iuniani ’——‘Negem fuisse illam
infamiam iudicii corrupti? negem illam rem agitatam in con-
cionibus? iactatam in iudiciis? commemoratam in senatu?
evellam ex animis hominum tantam opinionem? tam penitus
insitam? tam vetustam ? '—‘ Ego me, iudices, ad eam causam
accedere, quae iam per annos octo continuos ex contraria
parte audiatur, atque ipsa opinione hominum tacita prope
convicta atque damnata sit, facile intelligo.’

This being understood, we are able readily to understand

SECT. 3.-ἿἙε Gener-al Plan of the Defi’nce.

Cicero commences by pointing out to the jurors that the
speech of the accuser had been divided into two heads.

Ι. The first topic, and that on which he chiefly insisted, ,

was the conduct of Cluentius at the trial of Oppianicus. It is
clear that Attius had refreshed the memory of his auditors
upon all the facts as currently believed, and it is also clear
that it was upon the impression produced by these that he
mainly relied for obtaining a conviction. This is what Cicero
terms the ‘ Invidia‚’ the odium and prejudice existing against
Cluentius.

ΙΙ. The second part of the accuser's speech referred to the
charges of poisoning upon which Cluentius was more imme-
diately brought to trial, the three alleged acts detailed above
in Sect. 1.-This is what Cicero terms the ‘Crimen' or direct

charge against Cluentius·
