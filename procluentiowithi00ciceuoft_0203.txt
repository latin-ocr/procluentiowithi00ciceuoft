[1st11 atque exercitatione. ‘'Usus is that knowledge of, and
' ” ’ty with, legal matters which would be acquired by an habitual

..danee upon courts; ‘Exercitatio’ is the practical dexterity gained by

” 27. sapientissimum esse dieunt, &c. This sentiment is found in

³ '2 aiod, Opp. et Dies ²93

Οὗτοι μὲν πανάριστοε δι αὐτὸε πάντα νοήσῃ,
ἔσθλὸε δ’ αὖ κάκεῖνοι δε εὖ εἰπόντι πίθηται,

χ P. 95. l. 3. [Istam . . . fabulam] The words placed within a
„¹ et in the text are omitted in A, B, and some other MSS„ and are,
', r· many edd„ regarded as an interpolation. It may be urged in their
,ᾗ ua enee that the expression in ξ 86-· Illud, quod tum explosum atque

impeached. In 21, 5 58, ‘praevaricari' is applied to a pleader who
appeared to be betraying the cause he had undertaken to defend ; but

⁴³3 expressly (Digest. 47. 15, 1), ⁴ Is autem vanucmon proprie dicitur,
