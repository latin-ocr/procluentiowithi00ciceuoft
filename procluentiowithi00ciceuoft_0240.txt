P. 126.1. 1. Populum Romanum aliud nunc agere, i. e. ‘are
otherwise occupied ⁵—have their thoughts and attention turned in a:
different direction—are not jealously watching any threatened ἰῐιναςὶοιξ
of their privileges. So below, 64, 5 179 ‘Oppianicum aliud agentem„ 4
ac nihil eiusmodi cogitantem? Ξ

5. Per paucos iudices adstringatur. By you, namely, whose tle-⁷ ’ἶ
cision in this particular case will have an universal application. 2 τ

10. Qua lege. A. B, omit ⁶ lege‚’ and so Class. and Bait. It adds„ ξ
however, somewhat to the solemn emphasis of the clause. ¹ ἶ

20. In hominum periculis. So A, B, and one other MS. All thes, j
rest hav‘e omnium, ’which is clearly wrong, although adopted by most*
edd. See 6, ξ 17.

26. Hoc vero quum incertum et infinitum, tum obscurum et, ι’
occultum est. A, B, and the greater number of MSS. omit‘ incertum ’ζ
et,' and A, B, omit‘ est’ also. This is a clause in which transcribers·
would be so exceedingly apt to make an error that MS. authon‘ty, unless =,
there were no discrepancy, is comparatively of little weight. The J
phrase is certainly more rotund as presented by Lambinus, Ernesti, and ³
Orelli, whom we have followed.

P. 127. l. 12. Religioni . . . vestrae . . . pareatis, i. e. ⁴ the sanctity ,
of your oathl

13. Est enim sapientis iudicis, cogitare. Many of. the earlier ²
edd. have ‘ Est enim sapientis iudicis meminisse se hominem, cogitare! ἶ
&c., a reading which is supported by A, B, but which is with justice >
rejected by all recent edd.‚†ncluding Classen and Baiter.

ἰ 3. Non se putare esse solum. A, B, have ⁸ non se reputare solum 2
esse‚' and so Class. and Bait.; but ‘reputare' seems'less appropriate Α
here than the simple verb. ⁷.

P. 128.1. 4. Pro rei publicae dignitate. A, B, and a few other '
MSS. have ‘rei dignitate‚’ and so Class. and Bait. ,But the word-³·
‘publicae,' when it forms a part of the combination ‘Res Publica,' ⁷
is frequently abbreviated in MSS. into a single letter, and here is much
more likely to have dropped out than to have been interpolated. Everya -’
thing connected with a matter of this importance might justly be said J ,
to affect the character of the state. ’

13· Potuerunt. A, Β, have‘ potuerint? and so Class. and Bait. =

14. Decio. A, B, and many MSS. have‘ Decidio: and so 01355. ,-
Baiter, following E, has‘ Decitio. ²⁴

Ab huius familia, i. e familia servorum? i. e. ‘servis' 3

16. Dixistis. This should be‘ dixisti: which is the reading of most ἡ
MSS. A, B, have ‘dixit‚' which Classen supposes to be a mistake for
‘ dixti.¹ ‘ Dixistis' is a conjectural emendation of Manutius, adopted by
Lambinus, Orelli, and Baiter. ’
