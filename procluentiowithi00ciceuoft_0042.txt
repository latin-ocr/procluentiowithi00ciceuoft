of all other orders, and therefore the words of this portion of
the statute were made applicable to them only, Some years
before the trial of Cluentius, in 70 B.c., a change had taken
place, and by the ‘ Lex Aurelia’ the jurors upon criminal trials
were a mixed body chosen from the senators, the members
of the Equestrian Order, and the ‘Tribuni Aerarii.’ Hence,
although no alteration had, at the same period, been intro-
duced into the ⁴ Lex Cornelia de Sicariis‚’ it might have been
fairly argued that the clauses in that law which were evidently
introduced to repress corruption among the body of criminal
jurors‚ and therefore were made applicable to those who at
the time when the law was passed were alone qualified to act
as such, ought in fairness to apply to all who were eligible to
perform the same functions‚ although a much larger body of
men would now be included.

It is extremely probable that the jurors upon the trial of
Cluentius might have been disposed to take this view, and
thus Cicero found it necessary to concentrate all his forces
upon what he knew to be the weakest side of his position,
while he, at the same time, claimed for his client the credit
of marching out into the open field, and challenging his
opponent when he might have remained in perfect security
entrenched behind an impregnable bulwark of legal techni-
cality.

SECT. 9.—On the Judge bqfore whom Cluentius was tried.

In Chapter 53, Cicero thus addresses the presiding judge :—

‘ uid est, QNaso, cur tu in isto loco sedeas? quae vis est,
qua abs te hi iudices, tali dignitate praediti, coerceantur?

And again, in Chapter 54—

‘Iubet lex ea, qua lege haec quaestio constituta est, iudicem
quaestionis, hoc est, Q. Voconium, cum iis iudicibus, qui ei
obvenerint (vos appellat, iudices), quaerere de veneno!

From which we infer that the name of the presiding judge
