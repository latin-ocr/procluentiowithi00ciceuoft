praetorship, he was now obliged to withdraw from public
life1.

The senate at the same time passed a strong resolution on
the necessity of enacting some law, which should render the
penalties more stringent against all who should be proved to
have conspired to procure the conviction of the guiltless ².

A number of the jurors were brought to trial upon old
charges raked up against them, and five were punished under
different laWS, it being well understood that their condemna-
tion was caused solely by the prepossession which had been.
excited against them in the mind of the community ⁸. ,

One only, C. Fidiculanius Falcula, was impeached directly

J Ἰ· for his conduct on the trial, but although accused twice, he

was acquitted 4.
Nor was this all. Four years afterwards, the Censors
Cn. Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Gellius (70 Β. 0.), affixed a

's' - note of their displeasure to the names of three of the jurors

and to that of Cluentius himself, assigning as their reason for
inflicting this disgrace the conduct of these persons with
regard to Oppianicus⁶.

The feeling extended even into the relations of private life,
for a certain Cn. Egnatius disinherited his son in consequence,
as he alleged, of his having received a bribe on this occasion.

After all direct manifestations of public opinion had ceased,
the infamy of the ‘Iudicium Iunianum‚’ or ‘Albianum Iudi-
cium ' as it is sometimes termed, passed into a proverb
denoting the worst form of judicial corruption.

It does not appear from the words of Cicero, as we should be led to
suppose from the summary of Klotz, that Iunius was at this time a candi-
date for the praetorship‚ and that he lost his election in consequence of
his conduct on the t‘ial of Oppianicus. We are merely told that he had

χ’ , - been Aedile, and that he was regarded as certain‘of rising to the office of

 

Praetor (some day or other). Curiously enough, in the face of this pas-

sage, in Lemaire‘s introduction to this speech, Iunius is spoken of as
actually Praetor.
