54 INTRODUCTION.

CLAss VII.

It not unfrequently happens that a singular may be sub-
stituted for a plural, and vice versa, and one tense or even
one mood substituted for another without materially changing
the meaning, and from this source many discrepancies arise.

Thus—

§ 6. ‘ hoc postulo ’—‘ haec postulo)

§ 30. ‘ hoc cognoverit ’—-‘ haec cognoverit.’
§ 8. ‘ dico’—-‘ dIcam!

§ 10. ‘erit’—‘est.’

§ 30. ‘posset ’—‘ possit.'

§ 18. ‘ debetis '—‘ debebitis '—‘ beberetis!

CLAss VIII.

Frequently transcribers, trusting to their memory rather
than their eye, and having caught the general sense of a
passage, substituted for the true reading a word having no
resemblance to that which was before them, but almost, if
not altogether identical in meaning. Thus arose such varia-
tions as the following:—

§ 16. ‘ verum '—‘ sed.’
‚, ‘ putaretur '-—videretur.’

§ 1 7. ‘ defendenda ’—‘ depellenda.’
,‚ ‘ adiungerer ’—‘ adhiberer.’

CLASS IX.—-Manifi›st Blunders.

These form a very large class, and seldom give rise to much
doubt or difficulty. Thus-

§ 14. ‘solatium munerum ’—‘ solatium malorum!
§ 15. ‘amorem ’—‘ timorem.¹
§ 21. ‘indicit ’-‘ incidit!
