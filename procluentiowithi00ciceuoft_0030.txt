concluded, Oppianicus, who knew nothing of the counterplot,
demanded, as he was entitled to do by the then existing law,
that the jurors should vote openly, in order that it might be
ascertained that the bribed jurors were true to their pledges
before they received their reward. Singularly enough, when
the jury were called upon to vote, it happened that Staienus
was not present, being engaged in another court with a
private suit of his own. Canutius, the advocate of Cluentius,
endeavoured to take advantage of this circumstance, and to
hurry on the verdict1, upon which Qintius, the counsel for
Oppianicus, made a great uproar, insisted that Iunius should
wait‚ and then going forth proceeded to the place where
Staienus was engaged, and by virtue of his authority, as
T ribune of the Plebs, compelled him to return, and take his
place among the jury. The lots for the first three votes fell
upon Bulbus, Staienus, and Gutta, when, to the amazement of
Oppianicus, all three gave a verdict of Guilty. The story
about bribery had, however, got wind, and ten of the jurors
who were ignorant of the real state of the affair, but were
convinced that there was foul play somewhere, declined
voting, five pronounced Oppianicus not guilty, but seven-
teen, including all the corrupt jurors, who were enraged at
their disappointment, condemned Oppianicus, who was thus
found guilty by a majority of two ². He succeeded, however,

¹ Cicero (30) ingeniously takes advantage of this unjustifiable pro-
cedure on the part of Canutius, to show that Cluentius could have had
no private understanding with Staienus, since the former and his counsel
were willing that the verdict should be given in the absence of the latter.

2 The vote stood as follows :—

Nine jurors of unimpeachable character gave a verdict of guilty, νὶω-
P. Octavius Balbus-Q Considius—M. Iuventius Pedo—L. Caulius Mer-
gus—M. Basilius—c. Caudinus—L. Cassius—Cn. Heius—P. Saturius.
See 38.

Eight jurors, suspected of being venal, also gave a verdict of guilty,
viz.:—C. Aelius Staienus —Bulbus—-Gutta—P. Popillius-C. Fidiculanius
Falcula—M. Aquillius—P. Septimius Scaevola-Egnatius. 28, 36. 41,

''rhe five who said noe guilty, and the ten who said ‘non liquet,' are
not named in this speech, but we gather from a passage in the Verrine
Orations (Act. 1. 10) that M. Caesonius, colleague of Cicero in the
attineship, was one of these. ’
