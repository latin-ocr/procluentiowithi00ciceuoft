27. Mente et cogitatione. ‘Mens' here denotes ‘ a thought arising
,ι h the mind? ‘Cogitatio’ ‘the active examination of that thought‚' the
⁷ compar-ison of it with other thoughts and schemes.
ι 1². 88. 1. 6. Miser-rimis in loeis et inanissimis. So A and a great
“humber of the best MSS. and edd. B and a few others have ‘ miserri-
‘thus in locis et inanissimis;' four have ‘miserrimus et inanissimus:
3* omitting ‘in loeis? The reading in the text, although objected to by
snm.. is quite satisfactory. ⁸ Miserrimis' was accidentally changed into
ἱ miserrimus then‘ inanissimis' was altered to agree with it, and
'finally‘ in locis’ lest out to make sense of the corrupted words.—
ἐξ Classen has adopted‘ miserrimus in locis [et] inanissimis, ⁹ Baiter
< {retains the vulgate,
e 11. Quid tandem ¹?—nihi1 enim est. So A, B, and several other
3, WMSS.. and so Class. and Bait. A majority of MSS. and all edd. before
§classen have· qui tandem?’ In either case, there is an Aposiopesis-if
’ἐξ we adopt‘ quid· the meaning is, ‘Why need 1 doubt being able to
,ᾖ devise some plan, ron (enim)‚' &c.; if we adopt‘ qui,’ ‘How can Ι
ῥ’ devise a plan that will answer my purpose; but, after all, I need feel no
·nuxiety‚ ron? &c. See another example, 33, § 89.
α ’ 14. Praecipitantem igitur impellamus. ‘Praecipito' here denotes
f· ω totter on the verge of a precipice‚ --to be in the act of falling
ζ headlong: but is frequently used transitively 111 the sense of‘ to throw
hmdlong,' as in Ovid. F ast. 5. 633

‘Pars putat ut ferrent iuvenes suffragia soli
Pontibus infirmos praecipitasse senes.'

{f Grammarians, in order to explain this double use of the verb, say that
ἶ· when it is used intransitively we must supply ‘se;' but we could
J} scarcely resort to this device in the present case.
15. capit hoe eonsilium. So all MSS. and edd. except A, B,
Class„ and Baiter, which have ‘consilii' It is obviously a matter of
indifference which reading we select, and therefore we give the pre-
ference to that supported by the greatest number of witnesses. So, in
, like manner, a few lines lower down, nearly all the MSS. have ‘ eos qui‚'
and therefore we adopt this in preference to ⁴ hos qui‚’ which is found in
most edd. Hundreds of similar variations occur in the text of every
ancient writer. and in most cases it is a mere waste of time to dwell
upon them.

το. Praenesterus atque perversus. Although it may be difficult
to distinguish between these two words when applied figuratively to the
dislocation of the moral saeusties, the ideas implied by them in their
literal acceptation are quite distinct. ⁸ Praeposterus' is applied to an
