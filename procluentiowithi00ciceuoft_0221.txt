  “’ most part tonse-and lenient in the ‘Litis Aestimatio.’ ‘Itaque‚' he
f J'mtmues, as a proof of this-and then follows the sentence before uS.
ι *2 · this, according to the interpretation of Classen, far from being an
ἶ Justration os the carelcss leniency ofjurors, would be rather a proof of
' ’u ι ‘native persecution, since by the terms of their ⁴ Litis Aestimatio ’ they
’ open the accused to a fresh charge of a most serious character, and
f “ had happened in the case os very many individuals (permulti).
³ 18. Ad quos pervenisse pecunias. When an individual was con-
“’ ed ‘De pecuniis repetundis,' and ordered to make restitution, is his
.- -· y proved inadequate to yield the sum fixed‚ an inquiry was in-
’'tuted to discover the persons into whose hands the missing property
y 1ι passed, and these persons became themselves liable to an impeach-
” ‘ De Repetundis: Cicero here adduces, as an additional proof of
ι leniency os jurors, that, after having, in a ¹ Litis Aestimatio‚‘ fixed
ἰ n the persons into whose hands the property unlawfully acquired
’ ι passed—the receivers, as it were, of the stolen goods-—they had
'Ra · · to convict these persons when brought to trial.
γ ²4. Ut «lis haee eapitis aestimaretur. The meaning seems clearly
· be that which we have indicated above-Scaevola was found guilty,
·< the testimony of very many witnesses, upon a charge altogether
' ψ οιιιιεοῐεά with the trial of Oppianicus (aliis criminibus). The greatest
- :ons were made that the ‘Litis Aestimatio' should be in such
3 - n: as to render him amenable to a ‘Poena Capitalis.’ Few will be
‘posed to adopt the interpretation of Manutius. ‘The greatest exer-
»ιι were made that the Poena Capitalis involved in this charge (ut
- lis capitis), should be computed for a fine (aestimaretur).’
However much we may differ with regard to the true interpretation
· some of the above clauses, the argument of Cicero is perfectly ιη-
t « ’ διε-
< ‘One of the facts adduced to prove the guilt of Cluentius is, that the
ἐἰ - ·rs who convicted P. Septimius Scaevola, stated expressly in their
Litis Aestimatio‚” that he had received a bribe on the trial os Oppi-
ἶ -, icus, and this, ' continues the orator, ‘my opponents call a legal
.ss &cision (iudicium). But 1 need not tell you, who are so well versed m
¹.- ings of this sort, that a “Litis Aestimatio’ is not a legal decision
’Ὺ (iudicium). In the first place, it is notorious that Jurors, aster they have
jhonght in a verdict of guilty, are disposed to be lenient and careles s
‘in the‘ ‘Litis Aestimatio‚” and that even when, in the course of a· ‘Litis
Aestimatioss' they indicated the guilt of a third person, they often refuse
sto convict that person when brought to trial before them. From no
point of viem therefore, can a “Litis Aestimati0” be regarded as a
“Iudicium'' and it ought not to be called by that name!
