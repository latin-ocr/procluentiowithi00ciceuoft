actually ‘parricidium. ' and hence the words quoted from the law of
Numa (Pau1.Diac.1.c.,) Si Qum nonnum unarum nono scmus mom-1
murt, rnmcmns ESTO, i. e. ‘let him be regarded m the same light and
μ] the same penalty as if he were actually a parricide! See Rein, Das
Criminal Recht der Rb'mer, p. 401.

22. Ut una illud, quod erat, &c. So A, B, D aud several other
MSS.. and so Clas ss. and Baiter. Orelli, following other MSS.. has‘ ut
una illa et quod? δια, but, as Classen justly observes, the latter reading
would indicate that the death of the mother was as much an object to
Oppianicus as the dealh of the child, while it is evident that he had no
interest in getting rid of Auria except to cause the destruction of the
nbom infant.

²9· Hane ab natura propriam lucem. So all MSS. and edd.
“cept A, B, which omit ‘propriam‚' and are followed by Class. and
Baiter. There is nothing startling or offensive in the word, and the
expression without it would be somewhat abrupt.

30. Nihil ei clausum. These words are omitted in A, and
bracketed by Baiter. (Classen seems to have ovexlookoei this.)

P. 721. 2. Heredibus secundis. A, B, omit ‘ secundis,’ which is

, mained by Classen, and bracketed by Baiter.

10. Mortem atque cruciatum. Quintilian (I. O. 8. 4, 510) in
quoting this passage, gives—‘ vim atque cruciatum‚’ offended‚ probably,
by the position of ‘cruciatum' after ‘mortem.’ But Garatoni quotes

, from In Verr. Act. α. 2, ξ 138 ‘ad mortem atque cruciatum rapuisti.¹

12. Plures necaret.. A, Β, and some MSS. of Lambinus have
‘multos nemret) and so Class„ but all other MSS. and edd„ including
Baiter, have ‘plures' It appears to me that ‘plures’ is undoubtedly
correct. Cicero, in the first part of his sentence, speaks generally and
vaguely—the rest of mankind do not seem to be able to entail upon
themselves the guilt of many murders (multa parricidia) when dealing
with individuals‚ Oppianicus has been found, who could kill (at all
events) more than one in a single body. When speaking of the definite
crime of Oppiancus, it would have been absurd to have stated that he
had murdered many (multos) in the person of one individual, but it was
strictly true that, in killing Auria, he murdered ‘more than one’
(plnres).

17. Filium faceret. Observe the force of the tense in ‘faceret:'
he was in the act of making his will, but before completing the act he
first, διο. &c.

23· m testamento legat grandem pecuniam a fflio. According
to the Roman law in the time of Cicero, uo legacy (legatum) could be
bequoethed except through the ⁸ Heres ' named iu the will, who acted as
