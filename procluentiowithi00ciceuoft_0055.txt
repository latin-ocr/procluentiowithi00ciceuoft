We have, in the Preface, hazarded the opinion that Classen
attaches undue importance to A and B. There cannot be a
doubt that these MSS. occupy a high place, and that the
readings which they afford are deserving of all attention. But
Classen goes too far; for, wherever they agree in presenting
a reading different from and not decidedly and evidently
inferior to the Vulgate‚ he at once adopts it, although not ‘
found in any other MS„ or even when all other MSS. are
unanimous in favour of the Vulgate. But before we can con-
sent to impose such implicit saith in the authority of any one
or any two MSS„ it would be necessary to establish the fol-
lowing propositions 2—-

1. That they contain a number of readings peculiar to
themselves, and manifestly superior to those which have been
generally received.

2. That the number of inferior readings and mistakes is
small in comparison with those found in other MSS. of
repute.

Let us examine these propositions Ain succession.

1. The best criterion of the absolute value of these MSS.
must be sought in those readings in which they differ from
all other MSS„ and thus yield matter which is altogether new.
Classen has picked out sixteen corrections of the Vulgate
text which he first introduced upon the authority of these
MSS. He presents them to us as a choice selection, ‘praestan-
tiores quasdam eligamus‚' and says that these may be regarded
as witnesses and vouchers for the excellence of his revision.

The readings in question are as follows 2-

(1) 4, § 10. ‘hic autem pro quo dicitur,’ &c.
(2) 6, § 16. ‘ nam quae videre‚’ &c.

(3) 6, § 17. ‘ ego qui ad hominum pericula‚’ &c.
(4) 9, § 28. ‘spe optime confirmato,' &c.

(5) 23, § 64. ‘corrumpendi iudicii fuisse‚’ &c.
(6) 24, § 66. ‘datis muneribus‚’ &c.

(7) 25, § 67. ‘bestiae farne monitae‚’ διε.
