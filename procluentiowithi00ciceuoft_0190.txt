travit, 1. ε, ‘ and obtained permission that his cause should be plaw 1?
first on the list of those enrolled for trial! See the same phrase ag ' v}-

1. e. ‘they refused to put his name on the roll: and note on the last
mentioned passage.
7. Laudatoribus. ‘ Laudatores ’ are ‘ witnesses to character.'
8. Rem enim integram, i. e. ‘a cause which had never .--... ²
judicially investigated.' ,
11. Cepasios fratres. These brothers are noticed in the Bruttis
(69 ξ 242) ’
‘Eodem tempore (Cicero is speaking of persons who were seniors ta*
him by a year or two), C. et L Cepasii fratres fuerunt, qui multa opera
ignoti homines et repentini, Quaestores celeriter facti sunt: oppidano?

15. Iam hoc quoque. All the best MSS. omit ‘quoque,' which is'·
quite out of place here. Nothing had been previously mentioned um
w hich the arrangements of Nature could be arraigned as unfair. 3
19. Patronus adhibetur After these words, the following sentence
is found in A, Β, but is omitted in all other MSS. It is rejected 11)*ἴ j
Orelli, but has been adopted by Classen and Baiter· — ἶ,
‘Nisi forte hoc causae est, quod medici nihil praeter artificium*
oratores etiam auctoritatem piaestare debent! „2
This appears to me to have completely the character of emarginalfv
note, which was inserted in the text by some copyist. Nothing can be}
more frigid, and I have no hesitation in throwing it out.

If it is worth while to explain the words‚‘ auctoritatem' must signify}⁴
‘weight of character? No pleader at Rome of high standing wouldu·bxi
undertake the defence of one who was clearly guilty of an insamousi
crime. See below, 39, §109⁴ proinde quasi, '.&c ἶὲ

  
   
    
  

20. Agitur causa. The words are omitted in A, and placed after}
verbis’ in B; Baiter brackets them f
27. Addebat. ..vulnera Here the cause os Fabrrcius is tacitly
compared to a wounded man; Cepasius to an unskilful surgeon, who

in operating for the relies of one wound, inflicts new ones.

28. Ut, quamquam sedulo faciebat, ‚videi-etur. So A, Β, v
C‚lassen and Baiter; all other MSS. and edd. have

H‘oc quamquam sedulo faciebat, tamen interdum non (1010111101-0,50411νὲΞ
praevaricari accusationi videbatur’ —a reading which is highly 011300-ᾖρ
tionable; for‘ hoc’ could not, without violence, refer to anything except}
‘addebat nova vulnera} and the words would thus imply that÷³
Cepasius‚ designedly and to the bes t of his ability, was inflicting nevi}

wounds upon the cause of Fabricius. ‘ss
