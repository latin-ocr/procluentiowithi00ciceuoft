’ ,ἐ -oonditionem supplicii propositam timiditati militis’ must signify the
.÷ ι ishment held up beforehand to the soldier in order to deter him from
-ο ’· - lce.
. 'rhe orator having thus explained the considerations which guided
ξ the ancient Romans, in selecting a few out of a large body of military
ξ ν offenders, goes on to show that it is absurd to suppose that the Censors,
, in the discharge of their duty, could have been indueed to act in a like
ἰ . manner, there being no real analogy between the cases.
⁴3 32. carpes, i. e. ⁶ select. pick and choose.’
- ut velis. So all the MSS. Ernesti and Orelli have adopted ‘ut
. voles’ without any good reason.
· P. 113. 1. 11. Affiei convenire? Aut quam, διε. There is con-
ἴείᾶεηιῑῇε variation in the MSS. here. A, B, and the majority have
“affici oportere convenire‚' several, however, and among these C, omit
'‘oporteref A, B, have ‘ ut ad quam ;' C, ⁸ aut quam.’ Classen has recourse
,[ῑίο conjecture, and arranges his text as follows—¹ poena affici oportere.
Τ· Convenitne, ut quam,’ διο. We have adhered to the reading of the
’ Turin Palimpsest, which is quite satisfactory.
Ἀ 16. Atque· hominum. C has ‘et hominum‚’ all other good MSS.
u'‘ad hominum!
2 γ Ξ·8. Ad ignominiam etz turpitudinem. C omits the words ‘et
g turpitudinem! They are retained by Classen, and bracketed by Baiter.
2* 21. Ventum quendam popularem. See note on 28, ξ 77.
⁸ 22. A tribuno seditioso. The words are omitted in C. They
’ are retained by Classen, and bracketed by Baiter.
’ 23. Multitudini3 nemini licitum. This, which is unquestionably
’ the true reading, is found in the Turin Palimpsest alone. Another
MSS. have ‘multitudinem illicitum ⁹—a manifest corruption. See
¹ ’ Introd. ξ 13.
Β Α, 25. Illa iudicia, sc. ‘Senatoria,' ⁴ those juries composed of Senators
exclusively.· v
θ ’ 27. Notatione tabellarum. Cicero alludes to a scandalous transac-
tion which took place at the epoch here referred to. A certain number
‚⁷ 2 os jurors‚ in a criminal trial, had, in consideration of a bribe to be
33· ,ἶ received. pledged themselves to vote in a particular manner. In order
to secure their fidelity, and to ascertain that they had actually sulfilled
⁴⁸? their engagement, the suborners furnished each of the corrupt jurors
ι with a voting ticket, marked in a particular manner with coloured wax,
¹ > -’ ιο that the person who took the ‘tabellae' out of the ballot-box was
able to ascertain whether the individuals who had received the prepared
ζ, tickets had made use of them. We find several allusions to this
ζϊ business in Verrine orationi-e. g„ Divin. 12 ⁸ ceratam unicuique tabellam
