the notice of earlier editors, many 'important readings having
been introduced from them, yet they had never been collated
with sufficient care, nor had sufficient weight been attached
to their testimony. Accordingly, the text of the edition of
this speech published by Classen at Bonn in 1831, and
accompanied by elaborate critical notes, is founded upon
these two MSS„ and assumes a shape differing materially from
the vulgate.

Again‚ in 1854, appeared what is termed in the title page
the ‘second edition improved,’ ‘editio altera emendatior,’ of
Orelli’s Cicero, published under the superintendence of Baiter
and Halm. But, as far as regards this speech, it ought rather
to be designated as a second edition of Classen’s text. For
although Baiter has not servilely followed Classen, he has, on
almost all the most important points, adopted his views, and
very rarely adheres to those of Orelli.

Lastly, in 1856 was published that volume of Mr. Long’s
edition of the speeches of Cicero—a work of which Ι would
speak with great respect—which contains the oration for
Cluentius. Mr. Long professes to have modelled his text
upon the labours of Classen and Baiter3 and therefore, where
1 have been unable to adopt their views, I have been com-
pelled to differ from him also.

Τὴεε following is the description given by Classen of the
two MSS„ to which he attaches so mu‘ch importance :—

Α. ‘Codex olim Salisburgi, nunc in bibliotheca Regia
Monacensi sub no. 35 servatus, seculo fere decimo quinto
elegantissima manu in membranis formae maximae con-
scriptus: Cluentiana oratio inter triginta duas locum vice-
simum alterum tenet: sed ex reliquis omnibus, quantum eos
obiter percurrendo intellexi, vix ulla insignem varietatem
