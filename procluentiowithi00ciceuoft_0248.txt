etiam quae non commisissent permovere potuisset, adduxisset certe.
auctoritas advocatorum et vis tormentorum .- quum tamen nihil sassi sint, ³,
eum acerbo risu illud constantiae causam fuisse dicit orator, quod·
minime esse potuit, et veram causam, quam sponte quisquam intellecturus
erat, reticet, innocentiae conscientiam! This explanation appears to me ·
altogether unsatisfactory. Any one who reflects upon the tone and ἶ
spirit of the narrative, will perceive that irony would here be destitute Ξ
of point and force, and would, moreover, be in very bad taste. The„ ι
orator states that the slaves in refusing to criminate Cluentius, were· f ³
influenced by two forces—1. The ‘auctoritas advocatorum,’—-2. Ther-¹ ἶ
‘vis tormentorum.’ Ϊ ,
Now, in the first place, there can be no sneer implied against the
‘advocati,’ for we are told above. apparently in all sincerity, that they ’
were ‘homines honesti et omnibus rebus ornati‚' and their conduct, ’ζ
as described below, proves that they were men of sense and humanity. χ =
Hence the ‘auctoritas advocatorum’ would really have acted as an ¹f'
inducement and encouragement to the tortured slaves to adhere to the J
truth‚ and the only difficulty is to perceive how the ‘vis tormentorum’ ε
could have acted in the same manner. But Cicero, it will be observed‚ ,
states emphatically‚that the most excruciating tortures were unsparingly s
applied; hence we may, without violence, conceive that the slaves, ’
enraged by the relentless cruelty of Sassia, doggedly determinedrwith'
a sort of feeling of revenge, not to give that evidence which they knew 5
that she was so eager to obtain, and' their resolution was supported}
by the presence of the respectable rnen who had been called in to -τ
listen to their anticipated falsehoods. ’ ”
Since writing the above, Ι perceive that Ernesti gives substantially f
the same explanation. ’
17. Aversari. A, most MSS„ and the earlier edd„ have ‘adver- J
sarii,' which is clearly corrupt; Classen and Baiter, following B, have , ,
‘ adversari :⁷ Manutius introduced ⁶ aversari,' probably on MS. authority, ’
and this reading was adopted by Lambinus and almost all subsequent ᾖ
editors. Something more than mere opposition (adversari) seems to ζ
be required here, and the ‘loathing’ implied in ‘aversari' is quite ¹*
appropriate.
29. Verum crimen, διε. Observe the antitheses,

‘ Verum crimen—Ficta suspicio.
Aperta inimicorum oppugnatio—Occultae matris insidiae.⁹

Ρ. 135. 1. α. Instructam . . . et ornatam. ⁶ Instructam? ⁴ a shop ’,ζ
arranged and fitted up for the practice of medicine:’ ‘ornatam' ,
⁶ stocked with drugs and instruments.' ’·
