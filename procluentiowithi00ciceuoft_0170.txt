3²- Conflatum et perfeetum. A, B, and several other MSS. have
‘profectum‚’ which is adopted by Classen and Baiter, and, in itself,
affords a good meaning. According to the reading Ι have preferred.
‘conflatum‘ is the crude metal heated in the furnace in order to be
forged or smelted‚ ‘ perfectum’ the finished work produced from it.

P. 66. l. 2. Sed ea. vero sie agit, ut prorsus reticere nullo
modo possit, i. e. ‘But she is acting in such a manner that in no
way is he able altogether to refrain from publishing her guilt! Sassia
is the nominative to ‘agit,' Cluentius to ‘possit‚' the verb ‘reticere’
is used with direct reference to ‘sileret’ and ‘taciturnitate' in the
preceding clause. The meaning is so obvious that* any explanation
may seem unnecessary, but Classen, strangely, seems to have entirely
gone astray as to the force of this reading; he says that ‘egit' would
be required, although it is evident that Cicero is speaking of the
exertions which* Sassia was actually making in order to procure the
conviction of her son, and he takes it for granted that Sassia is the
nominative to ‘ possit) The MSS. vary much. Many have ‘sed vero,’
omitting ‘ea,' which may be a glossz—-B, E, and others have ‘agiu’
A, D, and others have ‘agiturz’ A, B, ‘reticeri:’ all others ‘reticere'
The reading adopted by Classen and Baiter—⁶ sed vero sic agitur ut
prorsus reticeri nullo modo possit ³—appears to me in every way inferior
to that of Orelli, which I have retained.

5. Est adornata . . . instruitur . . . comparatur. The figurative
language is taken from military affairs—‘equipped’—‘marshalled’-—
⁶ kept together and supported.' So in the next sentence. ‘ instruit testes ⁸
—‘ marshals an array of witnesses.’

6. opibus et copiis. ‘Opes' seems to denote, properly. wealth in*

money or p1·operty; ‘ Copiae' is more comprehensive, and includes all
the power and influence, from whatever source derived, which we bring
to bear upon an object.

10. squalore huius et sordibus. It is scarcely necessary to remind
even the young scholar that the moral feeling which prevailed in a
Roman court of justice was entirely at variance with the principles
which rule our own. Among the Romans, when an individual was
accused of any great offence‚ his exertions were not confined to the
collection of evidence by which he might disprove the charge, but he
sought by all manner of devices to work upon the feelings and excite
the compassion of the judge and jury, not with the view of mitigating
the penalty if he was found guilty, but with the hope of inducing them
to aequit him altogether. Hence it became an established custom sor
a citizen, when impeached of any crime, to appear in public, clad in
old, foul, beggarly raiment (sordidatus), unwashed and uncombed, in
