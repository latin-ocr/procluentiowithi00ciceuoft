²3. :perniciosissima flamma, &c. A most destructive fire might
involve the property of one individual only, but being a ‘commune
incendium: the interests of an were at stake. If the principle of
permitting prejudiee to influence the decisions of a court was once
admitted, au might have cause to dread the results, for the same
instrument might be applied to procure the ruin of any one. See
above, ‘ causa commuuis‚’ and note 1, ξ 3.

25. Aliis in locis. S ch as excited public meetings.

26. Veritas habet. So the great majority of the best MSS. A
few MSS„ D among the number, and most of the earlier edd., have
‘salsitas‚’ which seems to be a sanciful correction, quite out os place.

3¹· Iudiciorum aequorum. The epithet=‘aequorum' is here em-

* phatic. What follows is not a ‘definitio’ of ‘iudicia’ in general, but

of what constitutes ⁴ iudicia aequa?

Ρ. 61. l. 4. Ut nq quid hue. A, Β, and several other MSS. have
‘huic‚’ but the common reading is supported by C, and is aequiesced
in by Classen and Baiter.

6. Si ad causas. So A, B, Class., and Bait. All other MSS. and

’Δ edd. have ‘ac si ad‚’ which is quite inadmissible after the ‘nisi' of the
, preceding clause. Even with the omission os ‘ac‚' there is something
ἱ, awkward and abrupt in the form of the sentence.

9. convellat . . . labefactabit . . . extorquebit. ¹ Convellere* is to
pluck away by a straight pull; ‘Labefactare' is to shake an object
backwards and sorwards. and so to loosen its hold os anything to which
it may be attached; ‘Extorquere’ is to wrench out by a twist. Thus
is we wished to pull a stake from the ground we should first attempt
‘convellere.’ if this sailed we should proeeed ‘labefactare‚’ and finally,
is still unsueeesssul, ⁴ extorquere? The same processes would be applied
if we wished to deprive a person by violence os anything which he was
grasping firmly (comprehendebat). In the next clause ⁴ remittatis’
means ‘let go your hold.’

⁸ Oratio labefactabit’ is the reading of A, Β, C, and the Cod. S. vict„
but many MSS. and edd. have ‘ ratio labefactabit?

10. ΗΘ repugnetis, eamque, διο. We should rather have expected
⁸ sed eam)

ω. Quae contraria sint. So A, C, Class.. and Bait. All other
MSS. and most edd. have · Sunt‚‘ except Β, which omits thc word. The
subjunctive is certainly more appropriate here, sor Cicero cannot be
supposed to know distinctly what particular circumstance would produce
an unfavoumble impression on the minds os the jurors, or, at all events,
he would not have indicated that he knew that there were particular
circumstances which would have this effect; but this would be implied
by using the indicative ⁰ Sunt?
