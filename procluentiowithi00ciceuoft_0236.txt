chapter of the law. that which treats of conspiracies. In this ch 2
how different is the wording: here the law is' no longer applicable
any whomsoever (quicunque), but particular classes of persons are—
enumerated and specified. Ἰ]

10. Nominavit. This is the reading of the best MSS. The nom-7⁴
inative to ‘nominavit' is ‘.'lex Orelli, without authority, read,-
‘nominantur‚' and adds-⁶ perfectum omnino locum non habet? A ha!

nominarat!

11. Qut nonum con-r. A, B, and many MSS. have‘ corr,⁹ and' so,
Classen. ε’

13 Qui eorum. —Quorumi’ Orelli and many other edd. print ι’-κ .-
words‘ Qui eorum' in capitals, as if they formed a continuation of th&
law which Cicero is quoting. But the orator is merely repeating thm„
first two words of the clause which he had already quoted, in order &df
call attention to them. 1 have, therefore, printed them in the text im
italica ''

14. Quid interest. A, Β, have‘ intersit.' and so (2135331κί Baias.
The question is simply one of punctuation. ⁴

18. Si item. A, B, have· idem‚' and so Class. and Bait. Ὗ

lege nolit. Classen has placed a note of interrogation after ‘nolit’ ,³
and not after‘ Cluentius: and earnestly supports this change. But 11ὴί
arguments appear to me destitute of weight. The meaning aad Μ
symmetry of the passage are evident. Cicero begins by asking (Νκωφῇ 1
&c.)— ‘Is Cluentius a person answering this description? Assuredlffiv}
not. Who thenis Cluentius? Whoever he may be, he is at all evm&
(tamen) one who does not choose to take advantage of the strict lemj
of the law' in his own favour.’

28. Se re ipsa.. A. Β, omit ‘se‚' and so Classen, but it ought to ¹
retained, for it is emphatic: ‘sua' and ‘ se' in this clause corresponding tu„
‘ mea ’ and ⁸ me ¹ in the following clause—⁸ Hic 5οΑ putat interesse, ιι 1.
ipsa . . . defendi: mo autem um existimo interesse, uz nulla in disp 7 7
tiones . . videri esse superatum!

P. 123. l. 5. Quae a me desidera-ri arbitror. A. B, have ¹ ι « s
te a medesiderare arbitror‚' and so Classen, but it appears to me
this change entirely destroys the meaning of the sentence. Ci υἷ’.
declares that he had yielded to the request of Cluentius, and ι
agreed to waive the plea that he was not amenable to the 1aw.But -,
