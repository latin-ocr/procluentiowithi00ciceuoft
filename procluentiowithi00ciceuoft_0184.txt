172 cronno Pno σι UENTIO. mam-16: ²

from the words ‘duo millia: which are found in A, B, and in 'the great ³
majority of MSS. Lambinus, Orelli, and most edd. before Classen and ’
Baiter, have ‘IIS quadringentis‚’ which rests on no satisfactory au· -
thority. ,,

15. Qui gener eius fuisset. Oppianicus had married Magia, ,
daughter of Dinaea. See Introd. ξ 4. ν. The use of the subjunctive
here indicates that ‘qui' is explanatory—‘inasmuch as '—the orator

points out to his auditors that Oppianicus got the will of Dinaea into Φ
his possession in consequence of his connection with her as son-in-law. 3·ss
So, in the sentence immediately preceding, ‘qui properaret’ denotes
⁶ because or inasmuch as he was hastening.' In the last example A, B,
have ‘curn’ instead of ‘qui,' which is evidently a gloss, and is not ,ἴ

adopted by Classen.

22. Decuriones universi. ‘Decuriones' is the word generally
employed to denote the Senators or Town-councillors of Coloniae and
Municipia, the chief magistrates being temned ‘ Duumviri ’ or ‘ Quatuor-

viri,’ &c., as the case might be. See 8, ξ 25; 15, ξ 43.
23. Nemo rationem, i. e. ‘ any pecuniary transaction!

25. Nemo illum aditu, &c. We have here a climax—‘aditu‚' ‘no 1,,.·,

one would visit him ’-‘ congressione,' ⁵ no one would make an appoint-

ment with him '—‘ sermone,’ ‘no one would converse with him '-‘ con·

vivio‚’ ⁴ no one would sit at table with him.'

27. Aspernabantur . . . abhorrebant . . . fugiebant. The first of ,

these words implies contempt and scorn, the second loathing, the third
terror.

32· Erat . . . eratt sed tamen erat.. So A with several other MSS.

B and other MSS. omit the second ‘erat,' but, in this position, the

word was much more likely to have dropped out than to have been

interpolated. .

P. 76. 1. 5. Pieque accusaret, ἰ. e. ‘Fulfilling the duty which he
owed to his native country and sellow-citizens.'

11. Illi condemnari. So A, Β, and Classen. All other MSS. and
edd. have ‘ illum,’ which is probably right.

16. Venerei. The Venerei in Sicily, of whom we hear much in the
Verrine orations, were a large body of slaves belonging to the celebrated
temple of Venus upon Mount Eryx, near Drepanum. The great
majority of MSS. here have ‘Venerei‚' some have ‘Venerii,’ another
somn os the same word; while A, B, and one or two others have
‘Veneri,' which must be regarded as> a contraction or corruption of
‘Venerii‚’ and by no means as the dative case of ‘Venus‚' as Classen
will have it. ’

22. Pro loco, i.e. ⁶ In consideration of his social position.'
