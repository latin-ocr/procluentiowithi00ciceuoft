‘abducti‚’ which seems clearly corrupt. One has ‘ addocti: which

adducti ¹ is the harsh ellipse of ‘ ut iudicarent,' which must be supplied

ifi- ’Ὕηιίιι- use of the word from Epp. ad Att. 11. 16 ‘sed ego non adducor

this chapter are alike salse.

15. 11 tales viri. ‘Tales viri‚’ as Classen remarks on 1, 5 3, is a

A false Latinity, for the ‘quod ' here refers to one particular definite act
