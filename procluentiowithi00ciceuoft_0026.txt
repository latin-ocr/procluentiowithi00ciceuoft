14 INTRODUOTION.

9. Asinius, a wealthy and weak young man of Larinum,
was decoyed to Rome, at the suggestion of Oppianicus, through
the agency of a certain pander named Avillius. After some
time had been spent in dissipation in the capital, a forged
will was cunningly fabricated, and Asinius was then murdered
by Avillius. Avillius was arrested on suspicion3 and having
been brought before Q. Manilius, one of the Triumviri
Capitales, confessed at once that he had made away with
Asinius at the instigation of Oppianicus, Oppianicus was
then taken into custody, but contrived, by bribing Manilius,
to have the matter hushed up. The whole of these facts,
says Cicero, were proved by unimpeachable evidence, at the
trial of Oppianicus before Iunius. (13.)

10. The whole body of the Decuriones, or Town CounciI,

shunned by all, and no one would willingly hold intercourse
or enter into any transaction with him. Revenge against his
fellow—townsmen was the motive which urged him to take a
step which ultimately led to his ruin.

11. The affair to be detailed first produced a direct collision
between Oppianicus and Cluentius, and compelled the latter,
in sels-defence, according to the representation of Cicero, in
order to save his own life (7, 14), to become the accuser of
one who was at once his uncle by marriage, and his step—
father.

There was a considerable number of public slaves at
Larinum consecrated to the service of Mars, and hence called
‘Martiales,’ who seem to have been upon much the same
footing as the ‘Venerei’ in Sicily attached to the temple of
Venus Erycina. Oppianicus thought fit, suddenly, to assert
that these Martiales were all free men and Roman citizens.
The Decuriones, and the townsmen in general, indignantly
resisted this claim; and Cluentius, on account of the antiquity
of his family, his social position, and high personal character,
